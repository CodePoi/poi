There is not a lot of stock for each clothing piece nor is there a lot of different styles. Stussy has a lot of styles, but this store probably carries 50% of what they sell, which is disappointing because this is the only stussy store I know of in toronto. The worker also was pretty confused when I asked for sizes, and she answered 'I don't know\/I don't think so...' with a pretty uncertain voice. She just didn't seem knowledgable..\n\nStussy clothing is pretty good quality, but honestly I could take any plain top, stamp the logo on it and sell it for $40.

Ohana's has stuff on their menu that other places don't have and the food is cheaper and tastes better. They have the special sauce for crab rangoon. They also have a deal for 4 manapuas! They just started selling their pulled pork BBQ sandwich (with a big onion and tomato and lettuce on it!). It's basically the same pork they would use with the Kalua Pork EXTRA TASTY!

I'm afraid to even write this review... but... I did not like my food at Ohana Hawaiian BBQ.  I got the BBQ mix plate with short ribs, chicken, and beef.  The beef was so chewy and fatty that I couldn't chew through it.  The short ribs were gristly too.  The only decent thing was the chicken, but it wasn't anything special.  My fiancé had the katzu chicken, which was just okay too.  Afterwards, I was disappointed, so I ordered a thai tea... I wanted it to be better than it was.

(Scroll down for my thoughts on the place in general) I initially was only going to store a few belongings there, but ended storing my car there as well (more about that in a second). I received a phone call from Tricia shortly after booking the unit through the third party site. She was\/is one of the sweetest people I've ever talked to. She was thorough in explaining everything from pricing to answering any questions I had as well as being personable, which can be hard through a phone conversation. Little did she know her upbeat attitude and ginuineness relieved the stress I was having about storing my things. Not only that; but made me feel better as I was going through a rough time which is why I had to store my things in the first place. Thank you Tricia! Now to Mr. Tj! All i can say is he is beyond AWESOME! As I said before I wasn't going to store my car, but circumstances changed and because Tricia was so great I decided to check to see if they stored vehicles as well. I went back the following day and Tj was there and he even remembered me from the day prior. He got me all set up, explained everything in detail, cracked some jokes and even gave me a few places to look at in my apt search. Not only that, but after we said our goodbyes I had to go back to my car, grab a few things then wait for an uber to take me to the airport. Tj offered to drive me back to my car, but I opted to walk instead. By the time I got all of my things out of the car and looked up Tj and the golf cart were there to help me as well as drive me back to the front where the uber driver was waiting! This was probably the best and one of the most memorable customer service experiences I've had! If you're looking for a safe, (double gated and video camera monitored as well as climate controlled) immaculately clean place to store your things with no worries; and beyond awesome people you can trust this is your place!

THIRTEEN BUCKS!\nSince when did tacos become apart of the illustrious yuppie lifestyle?!\nThey even have a kids menu, which looks like a box lunch you would make for your kids if the main course was a pack of DunkAroos. \nThe counter was so white, it didn't even look like a fast food restaurant. \nThe website states that they have a philosophy of using healthful ingredients, and being picky with it's source of meat. \nI can use the same philosophy, open a corner hot dog stand, and sell the dogs at six dollars each, justifying it by claiming the dogs were purchased from Pussateri's, or some local farm.

I want to give it 3, but I will explain what the 4th star is for in a minute.\n\nSo went in around 7:30 on Friday. There were only a couple people eating and a couple more in line ahead of us. The service was friendly, however, they literally scrapped the last bits of meat (chicken for myself, beef for my friend) into our burrito bowls. There's nothing wrong with the meat, but it would have been nice to get some freshly cooked meat along with the last bits of the previous container.\n\nAlso the portions scooped into our respective bowls was a bit on the lesser side than the other locations I frequent. Do people in this area just enjoy spending more and getting less than other areas? Was this a one time thing? Not sure. I definitely don't enjoy getting small portions when I'm spending so much (and adding extra for guac).\n\nThen my friend wanted chips and she got salsa instead of guac. I can't recall for sure but I think the price difference is somewhere from $0.50-1.00 in the two options. But the salsa is literally the stuff they put in your burrito and as the mild one is basically chopped tomatoes is very difficult to scoop out of the container with the chip. So I would suggest not going for the salsa. The guac is pricy. They like to charge more for it. But it tastes so good. Nowhere else makes a guac this good (from my experience) so I would rather shell out the extra coins for it. Also the chips were disgustingly over salted. I've had chips and guac at another location and it was a decent amount of salt but this bag of chips... Oh dear.\n\nOne more thing, I'm not sure if I missed it, but it looks like this location only has one disposal area for customers... I was literally running around with garbage for 2 mins.\n\nSo for all the above I would give this location 3 stars. But then I visited the washroom. And it was out of toilet paper. I could have just made use of the paper towels for drying your hands. But instead I went to the cash and let one of the employees know. Within 5 mins she went and put in new rolls. This is what gets this location the extra star. They were friendly while serving food, and they listened and followed through on a \"complaint.\" Good service will always get you a star with me!\n\nI probably won't be back here again. I don't frequent this area and I prefer a couple of the other locations anyway. But this visit has taught me to always go for the guac with chips!!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I scoped out the menu beforehand to prepare myself. That didn't take too long since it's pretty simple-burritos, burrito bowls or salad. You line up and it's assembled in front of you assembly line style. There aren't a ton of options-rice, meats (steak (2 types), carnitas (pork) and chicken), some vegetables, beans, rice and toppings like salsa, guacamole and sour cream.\n\nThe restaurant is shiny and open with benches and stools. It's not really set up for a leisurely meal. The people taking orders seemed to be more accustomed to people getting stuff to take away too. I went with salad to save the 290 calories of the tortilla and my friend is on a paleo kick so wanted a kind of salad bowl without the lettuce but with extra meat and guacamole. I thought the server's head might explode from being asked to deviate from the strict set menu but she kind of managed. They were reasonably quick and not unfriendly, although I can't say I felt like they were thrilled to see me!\n\nWe ended up with 2 salad bowls-his with guacamole and we decided on tap water to drink for a total of $24. Gulp. These were not huge meals, by the way. They were moderate sized and served in cardboard containers. We were given cups for our water and waved over to the self serve drinks machine area. Between the 2 of us, we absolutely could not figure out where the water was and had to go back to ask. In case you'd like some, it's the teeny tiny silver button just over the Nestea one.

It was my weekly treat.\nFor such a large city as Toronto, I think there is a lack of burrito places and what we have is rather disappointing (Burrito Boys, Z Teca, etc.), and I think Chipotle is still the best.\nMy positive review of the Yonge & Dundas location also applies to this new location.\n\nThe decor is departure from the plywood, conduit pipe and corregated steel interiors of the other restaurants. It looks more modern, brighter and upscale. The only down side is that it doesn't pack enough seating.\n\nThe food is always good, the meats are humanely raised and hormone free and freshly grilled. The only change is that they now offer a brown rice option which a great plus if you are trying to avoid processed grains like white rice. My favorites are the grilled chicken and the stewed pulled pork.\nI always get the hot salsa which has a decent amount of heat, and I also shake some of the great chipotle flavoured Tobasco sauce which the smokey flavour makes any food come to life. If I see a bottle of this in the supermarket I will be sure to get it -- it's that good.\n\nWhen I was there recently they haven't got their credit card reader working yet and they are still waiting for their liquor license, but I'm sure they will have those fixed soon.\n\nI eagerly waiting for a location to open on the West side of town.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

This one is a bit far from my work, but I decided to walk the distance to try it. Conclusion: worst burrito place ever.\n\nIt was my first time trying Chipotle and when I got to the cashier, my bowl looked extremely small. I disregarded and thought that was how it was supposed to be. I didn't even have a reference because people in front of me ordered burritos. As I'm eating my meal, I tell my friend about how the portions are very small at Chipotle and she says that I'm actually missing not one, not two, but THREE ingredients that they're supposed to included at no extra charge (veggies consisting of onion and pepper, corn, and lettuce).\n\nI look over at the counter and indeed, an employee was dumping lettuce onto everyone else's order. I don't understand how someone could've fucked up so bad as to miss 3 crucial ingredients that's supposed to be in the bowl. \n\nI then go to Yelp and I see that I'm not the only one who experienced this! I unfortunately didn't get to take a photo, but there is one already posted on Yelp. The caption is \"From my friends snapchat, as he was surprised at my tiny bowl. Both were same price and instructions\".\n\nI suspect they are doing this deliberately to some customers in hopes that they won't notice the missing ingredients. This wouldn't work on anyone who goes to Chipotle often, but it definitely fooled me, since I was a first-timer. \n\nGo to Mucho Burrito or Freshwest instead - they're cheaper and the portions are way bigger.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I read some reviews here that it is better in the US. I call bull, I've had Chipotle in Michigan, NY State, Georgia, Pennsylvania, it is exactly the same.  Though I will say the Square One location is lacking. They have no love, weak portions, getting wrong two out of the 3 things why people love this restaurant.  As for the 3rd reason, taste, Chipotle's food is always fresh.  No MSG or any of it's other dubious names  'natural flavours' etc.  It's pure, well made food and none of it is GMO (yay no GMO corn), or mass factory farmed meat, hence a bit more expensive.   \n\nWe bailed on all the other burrito places when Chipotle's came to Toronto, as it is just fresher, purer, filling, and zero bloated, sluggish feeling after.  Clearly less salt is used here too, a restaurant staple to create flavour when poor quality ingredients create none.

I think the highlight is the tortilla which is large and pliable but manages to keep all the delicious fillings contained and minimizes mess (in case you're, let's say, riding the GO while eating). You can also forgo the tortilla and have a bowl with rice and salad instead. Great value at just over $10 as it's quite filling and well balanced.

After reading some other reviews, I hope I don't offend to many people with this one! I also promise that Chipotle has not offered me any stock options or even a free side of guac for this review.\n\nHere are some points for those who may not have tried this yet ...\n\n1. They have a limited selection if burritos, tacos, and a bowl. (Burrito without the tortilla shell). They offer pork , beef, chicken, and a vegetarian option called safritas.\n2. The bowls and burritos are 8.95$ before tax. The burritos and bowls are both huge and made with ingredients that are usually organic or from animals that are farmed with care, which is more than most similar places can claim. For some people, this is apparently the same price as a meal at Canoe.\n3. The guac costs an extra 2.21$. It is made in house. \n4. Toppings that do not incur an extra charge include grilled peppers and onions, salsas, corn, pinto or black beans, shredded cheese, lettuce, and sour cream. They have a choice of three Tabasco sauce flavours as well.\n5. The staff at this location seem to be friendlier than at the other location on Yonge. They also don't seem to try to skimp on ingredients like the Yonge location sometimes does.\n6. The burritos and bowls are delicious. You will be hard pressed to find a better burrito anywhere in Toronto.\n7. They offer unsweetened tea for those who like sugar free iced tea in the summer. (It is in the metal container by the fountain drink station.)\n8. They sell bottled beers and a margarita as well.\n9. With the 13% tax, a bowl and a drink is $12.20. Yes, McDonald's, Popeyes, and a lot of food trucks are cheaper, but this is one case where you get what you pay for.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The lettuce might make it more exaggerated but trust me when I say I received significantly less meat. \n\nI don't want to call out discrimination but this does call into question consistency. The reason one goes to a chain as opposed to a small mom&pop shop is consistency. I can take lowered quality as long as you know exactly what you're getting (take mcds or Starbucks for example).

It's always perfectly cooked with some pink on the inside! The reason I go for the bowl here is that they don't grill the burritos so I find the tortilla a bit too chewy and unnecessary on the calorie front. The bowl comes with rice (white or brown - I usually go for white), beans (black for me), salsa (the spicy red tomatillo is truly fantastic, hot but super flavourful as well), and then lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and I pay the RIDICULOUS 2.25 for guacamole too. To me guac is a necessary burrito topping and should be included everywhere.\n\nAnyways this is a super filling meal but incredibly tasty.

For my drink i ended up grabbing a beer for around $4.50 (they don't have much of a selection, but it went well with the burrito).\n\nI would recommend those visiting or working in the downtown core to try this place out.\n\nDisfrute ! :)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It's also great if you're in the area and don't feel like going to a sit-down restaurant as it seems to be one of the only street-level fast food joints around Front & University.

First thing I notice is that they don't have a lot of meat options of course you have the standard chicken, steak and tofu even. However I like seafood in my burrito bowls and that's one meat they didn't offer here...at least I didn't see any option for it on the signs. Ordered the steak burrito bowl, and really liked the fact that they offer brown rice as an alternative. Secondly, I found that they are very limited to topping options also. I like their salsa however I would like the option to add more red onion or other veggies. And onto of course getting guacamole added is a hefty price of $2, although it is plentiful\/tasted great it was quite pricey. The steak meat were actual chunks however I did encounter some really chewy\/stringy bits that didn't digest well. Added chips and salsa was enough for both to share and take home too!

This did not make me happy, I wanted to wait, 10, 20, even up to 30 mins for my fried chicken. Not 3 mins, because I knew the chicken would not be fresh out of the fryer, and it wasn't. It was old, not juicy, and almost cold. I was like Im never coming back to this place. I ate the entire meal, because I was paying $16 dollars for it. The side items, collard greens and Mac and cheese were very good. The cornbread was excellent.

The food was good (I'll give them that-1 star) and our waiter \"Carlos\" did his absolute best to improve our experience (2nd star). \nThe problem with this establishment is the Management: If that's what you call standing around in the parking lot talking to people and doing absolutely nothing to help your staff on a busy Saturday night. This gentleman must be related to someone because a Manger he is not !! What I was even more surprised  to find was that when I went through a few more reviews that most of the negative comments were regarding the Manager and to date nothing seems like it has changed !!So here was my 1st experience:\n1). No reservations, there were 6 of us (45 min. wait).\n2). Oder taken within 15-20 min.\n3). Food took another 30 min to come and came out one plate @ a time (one plate came out, then 10 min. later another and so on) until they got to the last plate which took another 30 min to come out ( I like to Yelp, good and bad so yes I was looking @ the clock: In disbelief and to give an accurate review). So at this point we have been there almost 3 hours and keep in mind the orders were pretty basic: Fried Chicken, greens, mac & cheese, Fried Catfish, green beans and yams (most of what should be already in a pot-the only thing you need to do is season and fry the meat).\n4). We asked for a Manager, no manager came -twice.\n5). A server's chicken flew off the plate onto the floor, no Manager (next to us).\n6). A server was cleaning off a table and dropped the plates, no Manger (next to us)\n7) We finally stopped a bald gentleman with gold wire framed glasses who said he was the Manger (because the one we requested never came). We relayed our experience and the fact that by this time our guest was so upset that her food had taken so long (the last plate) that she couldn't even eat it. The Manager's response \"This is not the way we do business but we don't comp meals\" no eye contact but he repeated it twice like from memory (did I mention our bill was over $100.00). The Chicken dinner was $14 and It was not about the money it was about the Customer Service (but a trained and educated Manager would have known this) !\n8). In comes Carlos (the Waiter), who we let know it was obvious he had no Management support and we knew he was doing his best. Again he was apologetic and sincere and even took $7 off of the bill (it was still over $100 for Fried Chicken and Cat Fish).\n***So if you want to wait along time to be seated and even longer for your food, be ignored by Management (who could care less if you have a good experience or not) and pay over $100 for some pretty good chicken and fish - This is the place for you !!\n\nOtherwise spend your money somewhere else where they \"Thank you for coming\" !","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

I thought that was a good idea. \n\nThe overall atmosphere is good. Nice music playing, lighting etc. A really good atmosphere. I think this place might be great if you were going for drinks only. Good menu selection, good prices etc. So now I got you wondering why the one star review. \n\nIt only took about 30 min to seat us but it took over 1 1\/2 hour to get our food from the time we ordered. The server only checked on us once for refills during that entire wait. He comes out and said sorry for the wait but we are busier than usual and I guess it has to do with \"bike week\", then he says your order is up next there is only two orders ahead of you now. Let me think about the definition of the term \"next\"...hmmm \"your order is up next, there are only two orders ahead of you\" well.....let's continue. A while later our food comes out and it was horrible. Let me repeat that horrible. I ordered the biscuits and gravy which is supposed to come with biscuits and gravy, eggs and potatoes. I ordered a side of bacon. What I got was biscuits and gravy, potatoes and my bacon. No eggs which I ordered over medium. The gravy was like paste and all of my food was cold. Not luke warm but cold.

While the food was pretty good, nothing else was. The staff was horrible and rude when it came to everything from being the hostess down to waiting on tables. No one seemed interested in thier paying jobs or cared what thier customers needs were. We waited over 45 minutes to get a table simply because the staff failed to keep up with busing tables and cleaning them off in a timely manner when other patrons left. After that, it took 15 minutes just to get our waitress to pay attention to us only for her to leave half way through our service, never to return. An hour after ordering our food, it arrived with a completely different waitress who was able to salvage what was left of our good time. And did I mention there were flies, most likely due to the slow clean up skills from the staff. I wish I could blame being busy as to why we were treated so poorly but a good chunk of the tables were empty. All that was left on them were the previous cutomers meals that still had not been cleaned up. Finally, we were informed that senior and military discounts are only applicable Monday through Thursday","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The menu is a bit limited in scope featuring dozens of iterations of their featured foods Lo Lo's delivers multiple southern-style sides like grits, rice and gravy, fried okra, collard greens, red beans and rice, fries, mac & cheese, and eggs. Make no mistake, one could easily fill up on side dishes.\n\nYou'll find Lo Lo's (if you're lucky) in the SoJack (I'm inventing terms here for the area south of Jackson) off Central. It is a small house-looking structure with a gated door on it. Inside you will find cramped confines that will have the loud and lively wait staff running around you with dishes and cups no matter where you sit. Don't expect quiet, you won't find it. Don't expect privacy, you left that at home. Come and enjoy the people and the food. It is worth the trip and for the experience. We are lucky to have a place like this. The Southern Kitchen in Tacoma was one of the few authentic Southern food places that I have found outside of the south. To have Lo Lo's bringing some culture to AZ is much appreciated.

However, no rescue should over-promise and under-deliver and certainly should treat someone who cares enough about the homelessness of the animals to adopt, rather than buy from a breeder, with some respect.  I want to know exactly what I'm getting and not be told something is going to happen if it isn't.  I adopted a dog recently from here.  The rescue makes the statement: \"All adopted dogs have been spayed, neutered, vaccinated and microchipped\".  It wasn't completely true.  When I received records, it turns out only rabies had been done previously without Bordetella or distemper, despite the fact the dog was at a pet resort that required those vaccinations prior to the adoption, but the pet resort taking him in without required vaccinations is another story altogether.  Further, when I asked for vaccination information and then asked again during a medical issue only within a week of adoption, (it was an owner surrender, so they knew the original family contact information) I was not answered by Melanie until I prodded for a response by asking the volunteer Laurie to please get her to respond to me.  When she did finally respond during the medical issue, I asked a simple question about if she knew what he was fed by previous owners or the pet resort he was held in before adoption.  I received a rude, sarcastic response from her.  I explained that I was at the vets and the vet was asking, so she toned down her attitude a bit, but the first response was very off-putting.  Another issue: I was promised the microchip before pick up of the dog but that never happened.  Then I was promised it would be done during the time the dog was going to be boarding for an overnight with Melanie (the week after I adopted him).  My trip was canceled so I asked Melanie to please set up a time that's convenient for her to just do the microchip and I would meet her anywhere that was convenient for her.  No response.  Waited a few days and again texted her asking to give me a time that is convenient for her to get him microchipped.  Again, no response.  So I give up and will get it done elsewhere.  It's not the issue of cost because it can be done for a reasonable amount.  It's the lack of follow-through by Melanie to do what she says, in writing, that she is going to do.  The volunteer Laurie was great but Melanie, who owns the rescue.....not responsive at all and under-delivered what she promised as part of the adoption fee.  It's a shame she doesn't respond because she wants help with all the rescues she has, but once you adopt you are on your own without support.  Her lack of responsiveness will turn adopters away, which is the exact opposite result I would think she wants.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

What can I say?  The process was easy.  I first communicated with Melanie through Facebook, but then I got more details over the phone and arranged to meet Charlie (now Kula) in a couple of days.  She could not have been more accommodating and made it super easy.  Kula had to be neutered before I could take him home so I had to wait a few days to pick him up.  I was beyond excited to take him home and picked him up from the shelter as soon as I could.  I brought a check for the adoption fee and then also another as a donation for all of Melanie's great work along with all of the other workers and volunteers.  She was almost in tears when she saw the donation.  Melanie was super grateful and I don't think a lot of people realize all that goes into running a rescue center.  There is so much expense to keep these dogs as happy and healthy as possible before they find their forever home.  Even if a particular dog gets adopted quickly or does not need to be spayed\/neutered or receive vaccinations, the adoption fee covers the day to day expenses of the shelter operations and helps to contribute to the costs some of the other dogs may have prior to their adoption.  I can't thank Woofs Wiggles and Wags enough for their sometimes, thankless work in order to give these dogs a new home.

I wanted Southern-ghetto-fabulous and damnit,  I got it. And even though we showed up at 1 for brunch, we were still faced with a line literally out the door and almost around the block... yet we still put our name down and waited. The place is quite big so even with a large wait list our wait was still only 20mins- not too terrible. As we waited outside and got closer to the entrance, we kept admiring the people that came out with their to-go box, holding their stomachs and making jokes about being so full that they'll roll down the hill. \"Thats what I want to be like!\" I cried, super giddy with excitement. \n\nWe got seated soon enough and we already knew what we wanted (obviously we spent our time outside planning out our meal). Between the two of us we ordered: Chicken and waffles (duh), Fried & smothered pork chops with mac and cheese, green beans and corn bread, fried green tomato appetizer and a giant mason jar of purple kool aid.\n\nAs our feast arrived, I could feel my heart beating faster and my arteries clogging up. This was going to be a challenge worth fighting for. We started with the C&W and each put a half-waffle and half-chicken on our plate. My friend starts eating the chicken and I immediately go in a panic. \"What are you doing! No! That's not how you eat it!\". After giving him a long and passionate sermon, I bring a random server to our table to reinforce my lecture about the correct way of eating C+W. The server agrees:\n\n************You grab your waffle. Add a layer of honey\/syrup on top of every square of your waffle. You place your chicken ON TOP (either cut-up or whole). You cover the chicken with hot sauce. You grab your knife and fork (OR fold the waffle like a taco) and YOU EAT A BITE OF EVERYTHING AT ONCE************ \n\nAs he took his first bite I swear I saw unicorns and rainbows come out of his eyes. He finally got it. The sweet, salty, spicy, crunchy, soft, fried goodness that is a well-executed C+W. Its sweaty redneck sex on a plate. Its fucking good.\n\nAfter that, you could've given us a flaccid french fry and we would have still called it a successful meal. The cornbread was amazing, the mac and cheese was tasty and the pork chop was the size of an overweight chihuahua. The only thing not worth ordering was the damn fried green tomatoes: only 4 slices for $7, completely covered in salt, with a side of salt and some extra salt to go with it. Half-way through the meal we found ourselves surrounded by 3 servers and the chef, all gathered to answer the \"what are gizzards made of?\" question- all because they were afraid that we would be grossed out by the definition. We were all cracking jokes and enjoying their company.\n\nAs we were down to 1 fried green tomato and half a porkchop left, we started breathing heavily. \"I don't think I can eat any more\" said one person. \"WE MUST FINISH THIS\" said, well, me. Using every bone in my body to be able to eat the last couple bites, we took the nasty green tomatoes in a box and called the whole thing a victory. As soon as we sat in my car and turned the car on I grabbed my stomach and said \"I'm sorry, I need to do this\"- *takes off belt. \"OOOHHHH GOD. MUCHH BETTER\". I regret nothing.","useful":3,"funny":9,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Lo-Lo's popped up towards the top of the list.  I've never had chicken and waffles before - I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken (waffles are OK), but wanted to try it out at least once.  This seemed like a good place to go....although I had a feeling the place was going to be overrated. \n\nWhile I don't know the Phoenix area well, the restaurant seemed to be located in the industrial boonies - the street looked a bit sketchy, and there was this ghettoish sign painted on a building pointing you to the way of Lo-Lo's.  There was plenty of street parking, and I don't recall seeing a parking lot.  It's a cute looking shop - shaped like a tiny house decorated with some neon lights.  \n\nThe place is small - I recall about 6 or 7 tables and the restaurant had most of the tables occupied on a Friday night.  Definitely not a place for big groups unless you want to take over the entire restaurant.  It's a casual spot - waiter service is casual as well.  You don't have a dedicated waiter - they have 2 or 3 people on staff to help the customers as needed (which makes sense for such a small place).\n\nI'm not quite sure why, but it took us a little while to order - there were a decent amount of items on the menu, but because the menu items were mainly combinations of the same thing, we were confused on what\/how to order.  For our party of 3, we ended up ordering (I think):  Baby Ray ($13 or 12), Lo-Lo's ($12 or 11), and Stupid Fries ($8).  This place should really be a $$ rating vs. $ - our total bill including tax ended up to be a bit over $40 including tax & tip.  This was just for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer.\n\nFood came in a reasonable amount of time - probably about 10 to 15 minutes.  Portions were reasonably sized - not too big or small.  We had 5 or 6 pieces of chicken and 4 or 5 waffles to share.  The chicken was OK - I didn't find anything special about it.  Meat was tender and the crust was OK.  It helped adding some hot sauce and vinegar to help enhance the flavor.  Waffles were OK - could have been a bit better if the outside was crispier.  \n\nOverall, this place was OK - it wasn't exactly a place to rave home about.  One of the people at our table compared it to Roscoe's and said it was about the same or Roscoe's was a bit better.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We came in about 5:30pm and it was getting busy. We waited to be seated and I thought it was pretty cool they had a couch you can chill on while you wait. \n\nWhen we were seated, our server greeted us in a timely manner. We asked for some help since it was our first time and he did a fine job letting us know what was popular and pointed us to certain things I asked about. I asked him to go ahead and get our drinks while we decide what we wanted to get.\n\nHe came back and asked if we were ready and we said that we were. We placed our order (Number 3, which is 3 pc chicken with two waffles, and a chicken strip basket with fries and a side of corn bread) and then he asked \"So what did you guys want to drink, again?\" Wait a minute. I thought we had already given him our drink order and instead of coming with them, he came and asked what we wanted. That was a tad annoying. \n\nOur order was brought out by a lady who didn't really acknowledge us. Basically \"who had this or that\" and placed them in the center of the table anyway. She just left without saying a word or asking if we would like anything else. Right away, we noticed we had gotten everything except for our corn bread. We waited for our waiter to make his rounds but he didn't come back. It took awhile but he came to seat someone else so the couple seated at the table next to us got his attention and said that they were missing a few items from their order. So we weren't the only ones. \n\nAfter a few trips back and forth to them because he kept forgetting things they were asking for, I got his attention and said that we were missing corn bread. He said he would bring them out. I saw him a few times after that helping other customers and that's fine but he came back to our table and asked how we were doing...without our corn bread. I had to remind him again that we needed corn bread. We were almost done with our meal by this time.\n\nAfter he finally brought it to us, he started coming around a little more. At that point, I wasn't sure whether or not if it had slowed down or not. I figured it did since he was coming around some more. It was kind of too late, anyway.\n\nWhen it came time to bring us our bill, he had to ask us what we had ordered today. I was surprised... He said they had misplaced our order. How does that even happen? I've never heard of such a thing...EVER. I should have just told him that service was lousy and since they had lost our order stub, I didn't have to pay for the food. But since I did eat it (cause I was hungry mind you) and possibly a little too understanding, I gave him my entire order again.\n\nSo we paid and started leaving and I saw that it was as packed as ever. Worse than when we had arrived. I didn't understand why he would have time to keep checking on us at the end of the meal as opposed to during the meal. Now, I do understand that he may have been new or may even have been too slammed but shouldn't waiters and any establishment at the very least come by and ask if you were doing okay? IDK but the service wasn't on par with some other little restaurants I've been to. \n\nAs for the food, to me it really wasn't anything special. The chicken wasn't like how they make it out to be and the waffles were still kind of dough-y. I may have gone at a bad time but it's a restaurant and they should be consistent.

Now pair those perfectly cooked, cinnamon-y waffles with the best fried chicken, best shrimp and grits, and best banana pudding. Ever. Those are pretty much the only things I've tried... Oh and bacon but honestly, bacon is always amazing. Pretty much any where you go I recommend eating bacon. Moving on...\n\nBefore going to Lo-Lo's there are a few things you should know...\n1. This is not a place to go when on a diet or attempting to make healthy choices. You CAN eat healthy here (egg whites and turkey bacon anyone?) BUT it's no fun!!! Why eat egg whites when you can eat grits oozing with butter, crispy always fresh fried chicken, and waffles drenched in sticky syrup? Splurge here, it'll be worth it.\n2. The neighborhood this location is in is a tiny bit sketchy. Do NOT let this stop you from visiting. The place itself is not the least bit sketchy and the staff are all amazing. \n3. It's pretty small (they are currently building a larger space.) There could be a wait when you go (especially with a large group.) But the service is fast and the food comes out quickly. So fear not!\n\nNow... If you made it to the end of this review, you either still have doubts about the amazingness of this place (or you would already be on your way there) OR you are just preparing yourself for your carb party.

The waffles rivaled those found at Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles... delicious! The sweet tea was done pretty well... just the right amount of sweetness. Overall, I was pretty pleased with how everything turned out.

Then you try it and immediately realize that you still have much to learn in life.\n\nI've always been a big fan of LoLo's for many reasons. First, above all else, their fried chicken is top notch in terms of quality and consistency. In fact, their fried chicken is so good, that it beats out a handful of more upscale joints that shamefully charge more money for an inferior product. Make no mistake, Lolo's does chicken extremely well!\n\nThe waffles, on the other hand, are just okay. I'd describe them as soft and flimsy, with a slight cinnamon flavor to them. They're not quite as good as some of the waffles offered at local breakfast joints, but I suppose they're passable.\n\nI've tried several sides over the last few years, including grits, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese. All are pretty well done and reasonably priced. Their menu, featuring various ghetto call-outs, is quite amusing, even though I'll probably never try most of the stuff myself. Their cornbread used to be my favorite of all the sides. It's still very good, but they recently changed the recipe that now includes actual corn kernels inside. This is a matter of personal preference, but I much prefer the old way.\n\nI insist on ordering Kool Aid. Perfect for an intense sugar high, it's the same classic stuff that will permanently stain your clothes and temporarily dye your upper lip - just like the old days!  \n\nWe've always wanted to try the desserts here, but we're just so damned full after our meals, that we couldn't possibly order anything else.  \n\nWhile not everything on the menu is flawless, it's good quality and it's cheap. I have very little to complain about and for that, I give it a strong recommendation!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Revised LoLos to fins it nothing like the first time around. Then my husband and I checked out the one in Scottsdale, the food was good but the Greeter was very nasty. I guess because the way my husband and I were dressed they thought we were bums.

This is some of the best Southern style food you will find in Phoenix. I had no idea chicken and waffles were such a good combination until I went to Lo-lo's, so now my standards for chicken and waffles are really high! Haha!\n\nEverything from the atmosphere to their coffee to the service was awesome. Minor slight was that they did not serve decaf coffee, but no big deal. I ordered a waffle with two drumsticks and both were cooked to perfection. It's a pretty good sized waffle too, and the chicken just compliments it so well. Even the syrup on the waffle was delicious. My dad ordered bacon and eggs and he said they were cooked just the way he wanted them. Only other minor slight was that the dishes are commonly served with a side of grits and you can't substitute it for fruit or a biscuit. Still, not big enough of a deal to detract from the overall experience.\n\nThe waitresses were all so nice. They came around and refilled out coffee and waters promptly, made sure the food tested well, they even put on the Steelers game on the TV that was close to our table, which we appreciated. And the cold drinks get served in Mason jars, which is so cute. I love it when restaurants do that.\n\nIt can crowded, especially during brunch\/lunch hours. My family and I went when it first opened at 9 a.m. By the time we left around 10:30, there was a line out the door for lunch. If you go for lunch, get there around 10. But even if you get there late, it's definitely worth the wait. Lo-Lo's is hands down one of the best restaurants in downtown Phoenix.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It is in the \"hood\" but the inside is really nice. There were multiple tvs showing football games on this busy Sunday afternoon.  It was very crowded and the wait was about 40 minutes.  When our name was called, the hostess (speaking a mile a minute) said we had to sit at a \"two-fer\" or outside.  Mind you it was about 90 degrees.  I had to ask several times what a \"two-fer\" was before she finally responded and said a table for two. We took that table and it was TINY! I would have liked to have been asked from the beginning if we were ok with sitting outside rather than almost being threatened (which is what it sounded \nand felt like). Her tone was totally unprofessional. \n\nOk so the food....I had chicken and waffles.  The good: the chicken wasn't by Banquet.  You could tell it was the kind your mother chopped up and fried fresh. The bad: The chicken lacked flavor. The waffle was small and just blah. Not bad...not good. My fiance had chicken, catfish, fries and mac n cheese. His fries were undercooked and it was visible. He said the fish was good but also a tad undercooked. He said the mac n cheese tasted like it was missing something.  Overall, I'd give the food a C. I think it is very overrated or maybe there just aren't many options in Phoenix. \n\nThe service...two different ladies served us but once our food came, they forgot about us.

The area looks a little sketchy, but maybe only because I've always gone after it's already dark out. I've been here three or four times and they have never disappointed! Someone has been outside the door greeting every time I have visited. Even when we had to wait to be seated, we were given menus to look over while we waited. They are always busy and with good reason!\n\nMy family came to visit, and I wanted to take them to Lo-Lo's for dinner. We all tried a little of each other's foods to sample different plates. I always get Chyna's Honey Hots. Six big wings served with ranch. There has always been a lot of leftover honey hot sauce even after I've finished eating, so they definitely aren't lacking on the sauce. They have a great flavor to them, and they're always very hot temperature wise and have a zing flavor wise.\n\nWe ordered the South Side Chili Cheese Fries which was a MUCH bigger serving than I had anticipated. There were 6 of us eating the fries with our meals and we still had leftover food AND fries. The portions are very generous. \n\nWe all loved the waffles and various styles of chicken. One person at my table ordered the SoulFood Platter of Chicken Fried Chicken which is chicken covered with white sausage gravy. This was also great. It came with a piece of cornbread and 2 sides. One of those sides were string beans and red potatoes. This was probably my favorite side that I've tried so far. They are much spicier than I would have imagined. So much flavor, I loved this side! The grits were also good for the side order. The regular fried chicken was also very tasty. \n\nThe prices are a tad on the high side, but well worth it for the portions and taste you get out of it. The restaurant is also VERY clean. VERY, VERY clean. I don't think I can even stress that enough. Not even a spec of dust on the picture hanging by our table. And the staff has always been amazing. Our bill for 6 people was between $80-90, which wasn't too bad considering the amount of food we had leftover and shared the massive plate of chili cheese fries along with our individual entrees.

The manager came out just long enough to see which table we were and then disappeared into the back. Our food came out immediately after, but the chicken was overcooked, the eggs were overcooked, and the portion for their $4 okra side was TINY (maybe ten pieces).  When we asked our waitress what happened she had no apologies only excuses, and the manager never came out to apologize either.

Also quite enjoy the excellent waffles with it. While I'd heard of the pairing, I'd never tried it prior to going to Lo-Lo's. Just works for me. \n\nI also ended up with 3 mason jars of Kool-Aid, which I love. As the Mrs. and her visiting friend are from Australia, they are not familiar with Kool-Aid. When it came out they said \"red cordial\"! Me not being familiar with this red cordial didn't know what that meant. I guess in Australia red cordial has a bad rep for inducing hyperactivity. Of course there is the sugar but then they also think the red food coloring contributes. Since we really did not need our 4 year old and 2 year old more hyper, I ended up with theirs as well. Fine with me. I will admit that I did not finish all 3. Those mason jars are huge!\n\nThe rest of the group, kids included, also love their meal.\n\nAmong us we had several different pieces of chicken (breast, thigh, wing), waffles, grits, collard greens and mac & cheese. Pretty much everything was a hit. The ladies absolutely loved the collard greens and we put away about 3 orders among the 5 of us. The mac & cheese (a JW recommendation) was also a very big hit. We also modified our grits order to no butter (not sure if that is sacrilege) and while I don't know if my mouth enjoyed it quite as much, I didn't feel like I was going to die from richness as I'd felt after the previous visit.\n\nThe staff was super nice as always and we also love the atmosphere in there.

Small, lively, full of smiling people all eating, well......chicken and waffles. The line out front attests to its popularity. \n\nAfter finishing the Phoenix 10K this morning, our group decided that Lo Lo's would be the perfect place to undo all of the health gains we had made. Little did I know that I would be undoing an entire year's worth of morning jogs. It was the sort of experience that makes you wonder if you should consult a cardiologist. \n\nWe had a short wait for our table, but were able to quench our thirst on soft drinks, punch, and sweet tea. The staff was extremely friendly. Everyone who works here seems to love it. \n\nI am a big fan of chicken. I am a big fan of waffles. Yet, I have never had them together. Thus, I decided the only choice for me was their No. 1 Meal, called KK's. Three (3!) pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and eggs w\/ cheese and onions. I figured if I was going to eat at Lo Lo's, I was going to go for it. \n\nThe food came pretty quickly. The first thing that struck me were the two enormous globs of butter (1 in my grits and 1 on my waffles). In all my life, I have never knowingly eaten this much butter in a single sitting. That being said, it was divine. Everything was delicious and, while I am not a big \"fried chicken\" guy, I must say that all three pieces disappeared quickly. Other members of our group sampled the fried okra and the red beans & rice. I heard nothing but happy sounds as our table of 7 made approximately 15,000 calories disappear. This was followed by groans and calls for afternoon naps as we all piled into our cars to go home. \n\nLo Lo's is one of those experiences that should not be missed. But, make sure to clear your afternoon and, just to be safe, you may want to consult a health professional.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

The naive inner-workings of my brain caused by the culinary repression in the East Valley were so wrong.  So so wrong.  I will never forget the day I went to Lo-Lo's.\n\nSometimes when you combine two unexpected foods together you reach this special nirvana that you never thought possible.  For some people it is chocolate and bacon (tried that in a cupcake and did not like it) and for me, I reached the ultimate bliss with chicken and waffles.  May the clouds part and the gods sing hallelujah.\n\nWhen the husband and I went, we tried to keep it traditional and ordered some fried chicken, some waffles, some mac and cheese, and some cornbread.  Lo-Lo's clearly believes in the mantra that butter is better.  Everything is loaded with it, and I love it.  The mac and cheese was intensely buttery and creamy, with just the right amount of \"mush\" in the macaroni to make it down home and comforting.  The chicken is crispy, crunchy, greasy and flavorful... exactly as it should be.  The waffles are thin, soft and buttery with a hint of spice.  The thin and piping hot maple syrup was served along with the waffles.  I found the best way to combine everything is to shred your chicken as best as you can, sprinkle it on top of your super-buttered waffles, douse it in syrup, and then dive in.  One bite of this and you know what I am talking about.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with this place.  It's hectic and loud with the cooks and servers yelling at each other, but it's comforting and peaceful in it's own special way when your server smiles and hands you your mason jar full of soda.  You want authentic?  Go here, and you can't go wrong.\n\nLo-Lo's, I will love you forever, my body be damned.","useful":3,"funny":4,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

After being seated and ordering drinks, the manage AJ comes and stands over me at the table. He explains that there is no outside food or drinks. I acknowledge and return scanning my menu. After hovering over my shoulder he then states that he is going to take drink. I stated I understand the policy and ask if he can either expedite my drink or provide a glass for me to finish while I waited. He ignores my request and states either take the drink back to my car or he will take it. He then proceeds to stand menacingly over me, refusing to allow me to finish making my menu selection and restates he is going to take my drink, finally grabbing it off the table and tossing it out. Afterwords he does nothing to check on or expedite the I ordered and avoids the dining area.

We waited a full 40 mins for food and when that came out even that was incomplete. It took a full 55 mins to get our order in its entirety.

The acoustics of that room made it incredibly loud. The surfaces are all hard, the sound of the metal chairs scratching against the concrete reminds one of nails on chalkboard, but that's ok. It's part of the vibe. The AC was icy though, perhaps because we were under the vent. Our server was quick and pleasant and the drinks arrived promptly.\n\nWe mainly ordered some variation of fried chicken and associated sides with one of our party ordering the shrimp and grits.  Forty-five minutes later (the magic of texting and time stamps) the food came. There was no unprompted check in to explain why the wait was so long. When the food arrived we were told it was the shrimp and grits, almost like it was our fault for ordering it. \n\nThe taste of the food was OK. The shrimp and grits were hot but it seemed that the chicken had sat waiting for the last of the order to be completed. The waffle was warm and the corn muffins outstanding. The rice in the dirty rice was not fully cooked and the mac and cheese had congealed during the wait. \n\nI'm sure our experience would have been better had the food been hot and arrived more promptly or at least with some apology. It's always better to tell the truth and say we're sorry we forgot to make an item on your ticket than to claim something like shrimp and grits takes 45 minutes to prepare.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

They had been talking about going to Lo-Lo's and kept saying they would go there as a reward when they met some of their fitness goals.  Well, one coworker left the company before they made their goals, so they went there with a third coworker for her going away lunch.\n\nThey were a little curious where they were being taken when they ended up in the middle of nowhere in a not-so-great neighborhood.  They found a parking spot after 5 minutes of driving around, u-turns, and backing up.  They walked into the small house and got a seat in the very back on the side seating area.  The place was packed.\n\nTwo ordered a water and lemonade and the third went for the sweet tea.  It was SO sweet and SO good.  The jar they brought it in seemed enough for the whole table, but somehow she managed to take it down without a problem.\n\nShe ordered Tre-Tre's (2 chicken legs and a waffle) and a side of Mac n' Cheese.  They also split two cornbread muffins between the three of them.  They took a late lunch and waited a little while for their order so by the time it arrived, they were ravenously hungry and dug right in to the grub.  They didn't talk to each other for five minutes except to comment on the food and ask one another if they had tried it all yet.  The chicken was juicy and crunchy.  The waffles were soft and topped with buttery syrup goodness.  The mac n' cheese was creamy and rich.  The cornbread was fluffy and delicious.\n\nAfter the initial feeding frenzy took place, they began to slow down.  It began getting hotter and hotter, but they kept eating, drinking, and sweating.  It was glorious!  The server came with the bill and the gluttonous ladies were so full and in a food haze they could barely explain how to split the check.  They sat for a while before they were able to leave and finally made their way back to work.  They proceeded to dream all day about the chicken, waffles, mac n' cheese, cornbread, sweet tea, lemonade, and all the goodness they consumed in less than 20 minutes.  Some of the women were more comfortable for the remainder of the day based on their wardrobe choices.  Everyone else was none the wiser.  All that was left to do was plan their next trip to Lo-Lo's and also the sister restaurant Mrs. White's Golden Rule.\n\nThe End.\n\nThe moral of the story:  Wear big pants with an elastic waist and order everything that looks good.","useful":5,"funny":8,"cool":6,"type":"review"}

Then around 6pm we decided to eat the banana pudding that we got earlier, yes it was refrigerated the whole time.

I had full blown food poisoning. \nHere's the part that makes me not want to EVER return here; my husband called the establishment and asked for the manager, when he told the manager I had food poising and was really sick, HE HUNG UP.  So instead of saying he'd look into it or he would check the batch of pudding or gravy , HE HUNG UP. Really good customer service right there. Not to mention how sketchy that is for not owning up and being professional about it. \nSo we called the Heath department and they said there have been multiple cases of food poisoning in the area.... \nThis was the only meal I had eaten that day, so I know it wasn't something else.

There was a free valet. The place was packed, so we waited around an hour or so for a table. While we waited, there was a comfy seating area outside and water. \n\nOnce we were seated, we ordered the famous soul food platter to share (where you pick an entree and two sides, and this includes cornbread), along with a red koolaid. We picked the 3 pieces of chicken smothered in gravy & onions for the entree, along with a waffle and mac & cheese for our two sides.\n\nChicken smothered in gravy and onions:\nMaybe it was because I was so hungry by then, but this tasted absolutely delicious. Hot, savory, and crunchy, this chicken lived up to the hype. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and the gravy and onions added a nice salty (but not overwhelming) complement to the crunchy chicken. \n\nWaffle:\nThe waffle was great, and also lived up to the hype I expected, as this is one of the signature dishes. It was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The actual size of the waffle looks bigger in photos, probably because the plate is smaller than I imagined, but one waffle is still quite an adequate amount for one person. My SO said this was the best waffle he's ever had. \n\nMac & cheese:\nThis was disappointing. The mac and cheese tasted grainy to me, and the sauce was lumpy rather than smooth. The cheese sauce didn't taste very cheesy to me either. I would not order this again. \n\nCornbread:\nWarm, slightly sweet, and soft, this cornbread hit the spot. Great supplement to the salty chicken. \n\nRed koolaid:\nThis came in a large mason jar and was sweet, but not too sweet, making a refreshing quencher to the savory foods. \n\nService:\nThe complimentary valet was nice, as there were a lot of cars and people around. Our waiter was friendly and prompt with taking our orders, despite the very full restaurant. \n\nOverall, I would like to come back and eat here again, but not on an empty stomach if it's busy.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I everything I had was great. The chicken and waffles were just great together. I had a wing, thigh, and a breast. All were crunchy and moist on the inside. My kids who are hard to please ate every bite of their chicken strips and waffles. \nMy husband got the platter with fish and chicken. His catfish was super juicy and flaky. Though the crust was very crunchy. On point!\n\nMy only complaint is how loud the music was. It was like being in a club. But none the less. Great food!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

My only challenge was the Scottsdale dj booth that played the music so loudly we couldnt talk.  When we first entered I noticed the sound was pretty loud so we asked to be seated in a quieter part of the restaurant.  It didnt help.  \nWe shared the green bean appetizer to start, and it was quite good.  Crispy, not greasy and the sauce was a great accompaniment.  Have tried their foods a few times and am always impressed with vegetable sides.  Their greens are incredible and I always enjoy the grits.  Ive been told by the servers that the greens are not made with any meat, but the flavor is impressive.\nMalazia's Focheezy Juicy Hood Burger was tasty, we also tried the traditional chicken and waffles which are always a good choice.  All the food we tried was well prepared and enjoyable.  Having tried the Banana Puddin in the past, we knew it to be a great end to our meal, but none of us had room to eat it.  \nI will go back to the Central Phoenix location again, and may even try Scottsdale during the day to see if the music is turned down at all.

AH!\n\nWe let the ladies know we were there and they (very sweetly) accommodated us, (probably because we were only two people and fit on a postage stamp).\n\nI did not have the Kool Aid, but an alcoholic beverage at the top of their \"drinks\" menu and it was FANTASTIC. I\"m almost positive it had red Kool Aid, vodka and pineapple juice.\n\nI ordered Betty's Boob, a perfect combo to taste their chicken and SCRUMPTIOUS waffle and then ordered Mac & Cheese and Cheese Grits on the side.  \n\nThe Betty's Boob was AMAZING.  The waffle was scrumptious and the chicken skin was fabulous.  The meat itself was juicy, but not in the right way.  The interior meat was a little dry, but the outer meat was juicy.  But I'm nitpicking. \n\nWe were told the Mac was amazing, and I will say as a Mac and Cheese aficionado, it was not good.  It was not creamy in any sense, and was definitely more Southern in style as it was Mac you could build with (thick).  Not the creamy type I have come to adore.  \n\nThe Cheese Grits were gone in a matter of seconds. I LOVED them.\n\nWe also ordered Red Velvet cake at the end, to see what all of the fuss was about and it was BAD.  The driest and least cocoa-y Red Velvet cake I have ever had.  The cream cheese icing is so cloyingly sweet, it almost hurt my teeth going in.  I would like to see their recipe include more oil\/egg to give a more moist texture.  \n\nI will say I smelled Collard Greens walking buy me all morning and WISHED I had ordered them instead of my Mac.  I will DEFINITELY order them next time.\n\nOur waitress was AMAZING and when I walked away from my birthday present under the table, a nice guy came up and made sure I didn't leave without it.\n\nNormally from food alone, this would get a 3, but I want to try a BUNCH more sides that looked awesome, and the service was impeccable. :)","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I had to let my food settle before I began writing. I am still in a food coma. I can compare this food coma to being Ryan Lochte for maybe 30 mins, because I feel slow and DUMB- Jeah!  When driving to this place, you better look for it or you will miss it, but it is kind of hard to miss with people surrounding the door waiting to get in. \n\nWe found a parking spot, walked in, gave our name and waited a total of 10 mins. We actually stood outside of the door for a minute or two before we went inside to see if your name was called.  I have been wanting to come to this restaurant for along time now so I am glad I went with my friend Tamirra. She told me to pace myself because if not I will get sick.  I seriously thought by the end of this lunch date I would be sweating grease and my pores would ooze of grease. I order the #9 lil amadi. I order it with 2 thighs and one waffle. It came out in 10 mins and all I can say is Oh my WORD! It was amazeballs.  The chicken skin was crispy and juicy and the waffle could have been in the waffle iron for a tad longer but it wasn't mushy by any means. For the drink, I just ordered a water. There were two girls sitting next to me asking what the kool aid menu was, have you ever imagined asking a server what the koolaid menu was for the day? The server gave the colors and the respective flavors. She named them off: red, blue and purple and then went into the actual flavors tropical punch, blue raspberry and grape.  Classy! :) \n\nOverall the meal was really good, the service was good as well. The server came probably a handful of times, to give us our drinks, take our order, give us boxes and the check.\n\nThe only complaint that I have, which isn't even my problem but apparently they do not allow outside drinks inside of the restaurant. There was a gentleman drinking a starbucks coffee and a server actually stood there and waited for him to take a \"last sip\" before he had to hand it over.

Celebrating a birthday and return from the army with my family we decided to go here...whenever my sister is on leave from the army we always go at least once before she reports back. Anyway this is not important what is is the fact that the collard greens were on point today so amazing so good slightly spicier than normal but amazing nonetheless. The catfish out of this world it was crunchy it wasn't murky absolutely perfect! Also important to the story you should know that I literally get paid to taste it is my job I'm a chef. Now here's what happened...I ordered the fried chicken and waffles for my children I tasted a piece of chicken because I noticed that they were not eating it and it tasted like peanut butter. Keep in mind that I am at a table with three adults and three children with one more adult also a chef on the way to join us. Working in the industry I called over my server and I mentioned it to him he went to the manager which is what you're supposed to do they tasted a different piece of chicken and proceeded to come and literally disrespect me in front of my whole family. The general manager told me that not only were my taste buds wrong but I should eat less peanut butter. Seriously eat less peanut butter? Now I sat there shocked but I told him the other adults also tasted the same thing he said they were wrong. Then the manager accuses me of actively looking for something to complain of in my meal to get free things. Keep in mind I didn't even order the chicken which he then mocked me for eating my kids food. I had catfish which I ate all of and it was amazing. Also keep in mind that I still proceeded to spend more money on a dessert and drinks but they decided to freeze out our whole table and we sat and waited for 25 minutes for our bill nobody came. When our other guests came to join no one came to take his order so he shared a water with me and ate the leftover food from the birthday girl. No one even acknowledged us we had to flag down another completely different server or maybe it was a busser to get our tab. I wish I would've recorded his response(manager) to me because it was that outlandish. So sadly my first yelp review ever is a terrible one.","useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

As a person of color who has eaten in a variety of soul food restaurants over the past 35+ years, I feel right at home here. Maurice and his staff at the Phoenix location take excellent care of their customers and regulars. \n\nI always have the same thing: The lil' Amati; I have for years. The chicken is always juicy and the waffles are always hot. For add ons I will get the cornbread muffin and the mac n' cheese. \n\nMy husband has tried a variety of dishes: the chicken sandwich, fried zucchini, the steak and egg breakfast, and the salads; he has also had some variation of the chicken and waffles. His favorite is the salad because the chicken is good and he isn't straying too far from his eating plan. \n\nI love the atmosphere and the food. \n\nI have read a few reviews from white people complaining about the service at the Phoenix location. I feel like I need to preface what I am about to write: I am not calling anyone a racist or a bigot. I am not one, either. Lolo's tries really hard to meet the needs of its (suddenly) diverse customer base. It will not always hit the mark. If you like the food but are leery about being treated differently because of your perceived ethnicity I have a suggestion: try their Gilbert or Scottsdale locations. Those locations are gentrified versions of this wonderful minority owned eating establishment. Perhaps gentrified is a harsh word. My caucasian husband who grew up on Chicago's south side says, \"White washed.\" Ok, that's harsh! However, the non-Phoenix locations are designed and run to appeal to the markets they serve as determined by their geographic location. It is likely people who don't feel comfortable eating on the south side will enjoy the food and the ambiance in Scottsdale or Gilbert. \n\nThe food is uniform at all locations and it is still very delicious.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The fried chicken is tender and juicy inside while perfectly crispy on the outside. Great flavor as well, and not dripping with grease. The green beans are perfection! Perfectly cooked, seasoned, and had a slight kick (heat) to them. The mac and cheese was also delicious. The corn bread muffin was moist, buttery and flavorful. I was so full, but had to try the red velvet, and so glad I did. The cake is so moist and the frosting is perfect; not overly sweet. The only thing to be aware of is that bits of the red cake get stuck between teeth. Looks like those red pills you use to check if you're brushing your teeth correctly (epic fail). I'm just glad I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and noticed my red teeth before heading out to the next event. So,note to self,  don't take pictures after eating the cake and be cautious if you're on a first date. If he or she is giggling while looking at you, it's not because you're funny (well, your are, but not for the reasons you think). Service was alright, considering how busy it was. \n\nThe HUGE negative is that I came on a Saturday and the ENTIRE parking lot (mind you it's really small) is valet. So, you're paying additional money to eat here on the weekend. You could choose to park along the street or in front of someone's home, but  I'm not sure how safe the area is. It's so busy on the weekend parking is limited. We got there around 10:30am and parked  close by and waited about 15 minutes for a table. There's a very small waiting area inside.

THe waffle is thick, with flavor rather than the crunchy thin crusts that many folks adhere too. There will much comparison to Roscoe because the other chicken and waffle places like Mrs. Bea's kinda suck...\n\nService:\nStephen was our host and server, and he was great. One of the best servers my limited life has the privilege of experiencing. He was on top of everything, constantly asking if we needed stuff. Keep in mind, it was super hectic at this hour and he just hustled. It got to a point where I can't even ask for anything because he asked first or was bringing it out... At the end of the day, he shaked our hands, and thanked us, and wished us a wonderful time in the 602. I was amazed how excellent the service was. Of course, with the exception to the skinny waiter\/host at Roscoes LBC, the service tends to suck pretty bad.\n\nChicken:\nIt tasted similar to Roscoe, even the menu had similar attributes. Nice and fluffy. \n\nLolo's Hot sauce:\nPretty damn good. Had a nice cajun bite opposed to Tabasco's vinegarette base or the pepperish mexican chiles. \n\nWaffle:\nDecent flavor but not as thick.

From my prior experience of them being so busy I called well ahead of time to ensure it would be ready when I got there. It wasn't. I waited an extra half an hour and was told it was my fault because I called so early. Rude.\n\nRegardless, the food was amazing and I wasn't going to let that ruin a restaurant for me. Went there once more with my boyfriend and had great food and great service. A few more times had take-out and they were all a success. \n\nThen my boyfriend and I took two of our friends there for a greasy hangover breakfast since they had never been there before. We were told the wait would be 40 mins. After an hour my boyfriend asked what had happened and they told us we missed it when we were called. Annoying but hey, maybe it was our fault and we sat back down expecting to be first in line. The hostess then came out and seated a group of like six who had gotten there way after us. Annoyed and STARVING we gave up and left. And I looked over at the hostess just livid and she looked right back at me with this smug look on her face.\n\nToday was definitely the last straw. We ordered take-out and apparently they no longer accept payment upon arrival. You have to pay with a card up front. Thankfully I work at a bank and have an ATM on campus so I could deposit the cash into my account for the $70 order we made. They said we needed the card and ID to pick up the order and I told her I was sending someone else to pick it up, the girl on the phone told me she would make an exception as long as he had those two items. And of course they told my coworker when he got there they can't do that but luckily gave him the food. The chicken was dry and tiny and the waffles were super thin. \n\nI'm just over it.

I wish I caught her name because I'd give her a shoutout. Anyways, you must must must get the restaurant staple - chicken & waffles. The menu has an array of different combination options (ex. Lolo's: 3 pieces with 1 waffle, etc.) and you are sure to find the one that best fits your craving. I almost ALWAYS go with the Lil C. It comes with 2 pieces of chicken (legs\/thighs) and a side of mac & cheese OR beans. The mac & cheese is a MUST HAVE!! And if you are into gravy and don't mind a .50 extra charge, order your chicken \"smothered\" and your chicken will indeed be smothered with their succulent gravy and grilled onions. In my opinion, this definitely hits the spot! However, during my most recent experience here, I decided to order the salmon croquette for a little change. There are several options for salmon croquette (salad, breakfast plate) but my server helped me decide on the salmon croquette platter which comes with TWO sides AND cornbread! I was so excited that I was able to get my favorite mac & cheese and buttered corn for my 2nd side. I'll be honest that the salmon croquette didn't excite me much. It was a tad dry and not as flavorful as I hoped. A 3\/5. But my sides were still wonderful. My mom and I saved room for dessert this time and oh my goodness. Their bread pudding is OH SO GOOD! Just the right amount of sweetness and a wonderful bottom crust. It comes with a mixed berry sauce and a little bit of vanilla ice cream. It made my night.

Its fresh, clean, simple dining and college casual environment appeal to the middle class pseudo-foodie in me, and it is to that restaurant that I introduce friends and acquaintances when they ask 'Where should we go for lunch?'  That restaurant is my public gastronomic façade, the place I almost dress up for, and where I know I will always end up, not because I am in love with it and cannot see it for its faults, but because I love it and incapable of comprehending a gustationary existence without it, my culinary spouse, if you will.\n\nLo-Lo's, however, is my lover.\n\nLo-Lo's, unlike the sleek, sophisticated, cosmopolitan Other, is the rich and rusticated temptress, a shadowy figure leaning suggestively upon a voluptuous Victorian balcony, or, in this case, against the brown stucco'd brick walls found between 1st and Central Avenues on Yuma Street.  The sharp, gentrificated Other demands poise, an appreciation for the obtuse nomenclature of Mediterranean flavors, and the quiet false dignity of petite bourgeois living: not unlike the maintenance costs of a promised cohabitant.  The artificial, hip vestments, gym membership, etc. all satisfy these demands.  Lo-Lo's, however, accepts me in the moonlight, when I am most exhausted by the petty realities of life, with my most basic of culinary judgments, paunch belly, and dimpled thighs, several of which were caused, in part, by my indulging in Lo-Lo's itself.\n\nThe chicken is succulent, always crispy on the outside, and never excessively greasy (if your definition of 'excessive' is based on a reasonable understanding of the genre of food that is served at Lo-Lo's).  The waffles are crispy and delicious, savory rather than sweet, and always served with copious amounts of sweet cream butter and syrup, so that even the most grossly over-indulgent might be satisfied.  The catfish is crusted with a simple cornmeal batter, perfectly seasoned, and juicy on the inside.  It's absolutely delicious with a light (or generous) coating of Louisiana hot sauce.\n\nThe majority of the sides are also delectable: the corn bread is served sweet-style, though not overly so.  The fried okra is plump and crispy.  The mac and cheese is some of the best I've ever had, and the candy sweets (sweet potatoes) both uncomplicated and complex.  The beans and rice are a meal unto themselves.\n\nThe drinks are very sugary, and unless you want to fill up on several hundred calories worth of sweet tea or (virtually opaque) Kool-aid on its own, it might be best to order water.  The lemonade is several rungs below both of those options on the sugary-ness level.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual, though not \"kick off your shoes\", casual; some of the staff live in the neighborhood, and they're very friendly and patient with customers.  Lo-Lo himself is often there on Sunday mornings, when the church crowds come to partake in his creations wearing their congregational best.  A Bose stereo in one corner of the smallish hallway\/first dining room area often plays Jazz music.  It can get very crowded at virtually all hours, as it is a very popular place.  Plan on pooling your money: they discourage separate checks.  The bathroom is small but very clean and homey.\n\nMy lover, however, unlike those mythological places found only in culinary rags and the imaginations of tunnel-visioned food writers, is not perfect.  There is, to a degree, a problem of consistency at Lo-Lo's: those ordering their fried chicken with gravy may sometimes find their meal slathered in a salty, caramel-colored sauce popping with the flavor of roast onions.  Other times one is confronted with a considerably thinner gravy of nearly-raw white rings.  The cornbread, while always delicious, is sometimes dry.  The staff, friendly and generally attentive they may be, is often swamped by the sheer volume of people coming in and out of the dining areas, and it is often difficult to secure seating for large groups.  Don't be afraid to ask for refills on your drinks if necessary.\n\nFor all its faults, I find myself unable to draw myself away from Lo-Lo's for any more than a few weeks at a time, like some strange, wonderful addiction that from time to time demands my submission, a temporal span which, I suspect, will rapidly shorten as I surrender more and more often to the need.  My friends and I even crafted a clever neologism to describe the unique sensation of simultaneous joy, victory, disgust and regret that follows most outings to this alluring outpost of gustational heaven and nutritional hell: to get Lo-Lo'd.\n\nIn any case, assuming a readiness for all its faults and its aftereffects, I would recommend Lo-Lo's to anyone not currently pregnant, elderly, a child, or stricken with some sort of malady affecting nutritional well-being.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

While I've never had Roscoe's to make the comparison, I have had The Breakfast Klub in Houston and DIED over their delicious chicken, waffles and grits so I was looking to be just as wowed. \n\nAll I can say is, it was all hype. Sorry!!! I know Arizonians everywhere just fell out of their chairs!! It just wasn't amazing, or even kind of good, it was just OK. \n\nWe went on a Sunday morning for breakfast. The service was good, we beat the Sunday church crowd so it wasnt overly packed but I was kind of shocked at the size of place, pretty cramped but I guess I'll give it cozy. \n\nSo we order, I love that the drinks come in HUGE mason jars (not so good for those wasted calories on SUGARY drinks) and get the chicken breast and wing with a waffle and a side of grits. Boooo!!!!! My grits were soup, I had to season them well to get some flavor and despite letting them sit for a little to see if they'd solidify. . . .no go. I was sooooo dissappointed. \n\nMoving onto the main dish, I dont love chicken skin but I understand the allure in the fried variety so I indulge from time to time. This time I went for it and tasted. . . .salt. Lots of salt. Double booooo!!! The breading was fine, not to thick or gummy when it hit the syrup but still too salty for me. So fried skin removed, chicken doused in hot sauce, I enjoyed the remainder of my dish and ordinary waffle and was thoroughly full but not too satisfied. \n\nOverall, Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles was just that, chicken and waffles and nothing to spectacular at that. 3 stars for being an ok chicken & waffles joint with good service and decent prices.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

First of all my big mistake was going there on a Sunday, Palm Sunday to be exact. We were told there would be a 30 min wait, which I was surprised due to the amount of people that were already waiting. So we waited and waited and waited. Well 30 min wait turned into an hour wait. \n\nWe finally got a place to sit and waited for someone to acknowledge us. Finally we got to put in our drink orders! The drinks came in big mason jars and I ended up ordering sweet tea ($3), which was so incredibly sweet that I couldn't really drink it. \n\nMy husband ordered KK which consisted of 3 piece chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and eggs with cheese and onions. I ordered Baby Ray which came with 3 piece chicken with gravy and 2 waffles. We also ordered side of collard greens.\n\nWe then waited and waited and waited for our food which took about 50 mins! The waitress never once came over to see how we were doing or even informed us about our food. The kitchen looked like there was no sense of order and it was chaotic behind the counter. \n\nSo now on to the food. The chicken with gravy and the collards were the only things that were actually delicious. The waffles were soft and dense, it was more like a pancake shaped like waffles. The grits were cold and congealed, I'm assuming it would've been good if it was hot because the flavors were decent. \n\nBasically we waited an hour for the table, hour for the food, and ate in 15 minutes. I'm not sure if I would return to give it another try but if I did, I would go on a weekday.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

As usual, before I headed over I took a moment to read the Yelp reviews.  How in the world does this place get such good reviews?  \n\nWe were a party of three adults and a baby and were told the wait was going to be 15-25 minutes. A party of 12 came in after us and were seated before us. Our wait was the full 25 minutes.   The woman at the front desk asked for a name to call when it time to be seated.  I said \"Darian.\" She repeated back Victoria. Umm no Darian, she laughed and said not even close huh.  She called out Dirk when it was time to be seated. If they turned the music down just a little bit (not too much because I loved whatever station they were playing) they could possibly hear their customers a little better.  The front desk person was wearing a t shirt that read \"Ghetto Fabulous\" on it.  Ghetto, for sure, fabulous was still something to be seen.\n\nThe food - Overrated and way too salty - so salty you can see the salt simply sitting on the Stupid fry.  My son loved the catfish sandwich and my daughter was sick from the tre-tre (two drumsticks and a waffle) less than 30 minutes after leaving the restaurant.  Serving the drinks in various sized mason jars was a creative touch - mixing all of the alcoholic drinks with Kool Aid is once again ghetto.  The drinks are super strong (maybe because they are mixed with Kool Aid?) I didn't have the waffle but just looking at it, I wasn't impressed.\n\nThe service -Lots of Lo Lo staff simply walking around aimlessly, chatting with the folks at the front door, walking in and out from the patio area, cackling it up with each other, not doing much of anything really.  I will say that our server is what made me give this review two whole stars.  She did a good job and you could tell (besides her telling us) that she was very busy.  She took our drink order and told us that she is also our bartender, so please bear with her but she will be back as soon as she can.  She brought the drinks and 20 minutes later came back with water and finally took our food order.  Same long wait followed by what appeared to be sincere apologies when we asked for more napkins and a take out box. She was very accommodating. Turns out she was also our cashier. Her name was Shamreya.   I ended up giving her the full tip that was \"suggested\" on the bottom of the receipt out of pity, quite honestly.\n\nParking - one word - SUCKED\n\nBesides getting sick, my kids (young adults themselves) actually liked this place - maybe because it appeared as if it was managed by young adults.

We finally tried this place out after hearing about it from several of our friends and coworkers who have lived in the area for quite some time. We read a few reviews, liked what we saw, and made it a point to go. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and shown to our table. The decor is sort of a modern meets rustic look.  \n\nOur waitress Leslie came right over and took our drink order.  The menu is huge, and we wanted to try everything on it. Needless to say it took us a few minutes to make our decisions, but then we were ready to bring on the hurt. We knew then that this was simultaneously going to be both the best and worst decision ever for dinner. My wife ordered the Lo Lo's chicken and waffles, I ordered the 8 double D's chicken breast and waffle, and we got an order of fries and corn bread to share. We also ordered two drinks off of their specialty menu, a Keep it Simple for my wife, and the tropical drink for me. Sadly, I can't remember the name of the drink. \n\nThe fries and the corn bread came out first.  The corn bread was good, but not the best I've had. The fries are hand cut with a glorious seasoning.  Anyone who knows me well knows my unhealthy obsession with french fries...It's rivaled only by my love of tacos. The fries never stood a chance. Every now and then I would pause for half a second to dip one in ketchup, but they were so good they really didn't need it. Shortly thereafter the rest of the food came out.\n\nThe main course came out on large dishes that were roughly the size of trampolines. My inner fat kid was practically leaping up and down at this point. The amount of food piled on the plates bordered on unnatural. It was about this time that my wife and I realized we may have ordered too much food. We didn't care. We were too busy staring down our plates like two gunslingers before a high noon showdown and furiously snapping photos for our future Yelp post. Our stomachs grumbled with anticipation.\n\nThe chicken was delicious, juicy, and breaded and fried southern style. The waffles were soft and made to order with their special batter. I went all out, ripping my chicken breast off the bone and stuffed it in the waffle, loaded it with butter, syrup, and hot sauce. With a big grin on my face, I folded it up like a giant delicious taco and ate it like it was my last meal on earth. My inner fat kid was getting worried at this point, because he knew there was more to come. Syrup and butter streaming down my hands, I enjoyed it to the last crumb. The waffle split and threatened to spill its contents all over the table several times, but I'm no amateur taco eater. The hot sauce is medium, with a little bit of a kick but not too much, and a nice spicy offset to the sweetness of the syrup.  \n\nThroughout the course of our meal, our table was visited several times by our waitress and other staff members. They kept the drinks filled and cleared away finished plates. Everyone was friendly and made for a great service experience.\n\nTo finish it off, we ordered the banana pudding for dessert. No true Southerner can pass up banana pudding when given the choice. I grew up on my grandma's banana pudding, so there was a high bar of expectations set. I was not disappointed. The style was different from that of my grandmothers, but it was still very good. They use crumbled vanilla wafers as both a base and a topping. As with the drinks, it comes out served in a large mason jar. Be warned, it's a big serving, so come hungry or be ready to share.  My wife threw in the towel about a quarter of the way through.

There have been a couple of times when there were a couple of unruly, obnoxiously loud (maybe even ungodly loud) people there while I was dining with my wife and 2 daughters.  They were using expletives and using language that had graphic sexual undertones.  Mind you, this was at a volume that was loud enough for everyone in the restaurant to hear.  The wait staff and management didn't even bother to ask them to simmer down and have some respect for the other patrons.  \n\nI've always had really good dining experiences at LoLo's.  The staff is friendly, other than a couple of incidents, the other patrons are lively and provide a good dining atmosphere.  Other than the two times I mentioned, I thought this was a really good family restaurant.\n\nI really do wish when incidents like this occur, that the wait staff or management steps up and ensures that a couple of people don't ruin the dining experience of everyone in the restaurant.  I am no stranger to eating in a loud restaurant where the level of noise is very high due to everyone having normal conversations.  The two times that I was unfortunate enough to go through this has actually kept me from going back.\n\nThere's no doubt I'll go there again.

Big disappointment.\n\n2.  Waffle was not at all crispy nor very warm (chicken was plenty hot though).\n\n3.  Fried green tomatoes were tasty but the tomatoes were half ripe (pink).  You do not make fried green tomatoes with semi-ripe tomatoes.  They taste different and the texture of the tomato comes out mushy if not green.  \n\n4.  Tea is a Southern soul food staple, however Phoenix water is crappy and the water there is not filtered.  You can definitely tell this in the tea. \n\n5.

It's hard to find a place where they put the right seasonings in the fried chicken, but Lo-Lo's got it just right.   A great balance of seasoning to give the chicken some zing and super crispy.  The catfish was great, with a similar seasoning.  Nice big filets and not greasy at all, same goes for the redfish.  The redfish was like a southern version of fish and chips.  I'm not a fan of gizzards, but Lo-Lo's got it right so that they were tender instead of rubbery and how can it fail smothered with gravy?  Let's also not forget the waffle, damn that thing was good, with some cinnamon or something in the batter so that it was just a good without the syrup.  \n\nI'm also an unsweetened tea kind of girl now, but Lo-Lo's brought back memories with their sweetened tea in big mason jars, just perfect.\n\nThe service was great as well.

No one can match their chicken - absolutely delicious!  Waffles are amazing; thin, light with a hint of cinnamon.  Mac and cheese, red beans and rice are right on the money too!  \n\nI'm writing this review after having contracted with them to provide catering service for a wedding rehearsal dinner at my home.  Wasn't sure how it would all go, but the sales rep, Toyesha, helped me as I narrowed down my menu selections, and also advised that two of their staff members would be onsite to set up, make the waffles for the guests (so they were fresh, and not rubbery and cold), and help with service.  It was AMAZING, the staff were on time, friendly and helpful, the food was delicious, and we all had a great time.

We went on a Sunday after church, and it was PACKED. We had a very long wait (which told us it must be pretty good!), but the kind people of Lo-Lo's were kind enough to provide us with a shade structure and mister-fan to combat some of that infamous Phoenix heat. They even had a water cooler with cold water for us to enjoy while we waited, so that we would not swoon from heat exhaustion.\n\nThe food was tasty, that's for sure. I ordered one piece of chicken breast and one waffle. Both items were DELICIOUS! Thank goodness Lo-Lo's knows how to make their namesake dishes, and make them well!

Forreally for real though... Ugh.... *Insert Homer Simpson-esque gargling sound here!* \n\nMy cousin and I were spent the weekend being hermits and I got tired of it and offered her some LoLo's, never one to turn down a free meal, she happily said yes. We brought my mom along and were Lo-Lo's bound.\n\nWhen we got there I saw the lil tent and mini bar of doom. I've read the many reviews warning me about Lo-Lo's 40+ minute wait... but seeing no one standing in the way of the misting fan, we decided to trudge on in... and we were SO lucky to find more empty tables than filled. We sat down in the nice cool mustered colored room, lined with Framed pictures depitcing the Jazz Era... \n\nWe were quickly brought menus and we ordered a round of tea... I had the Half sweet & Half unsweetened tea... my cousin chose the sweetened tea and my mom the chose the unsweetened tea. When the HUGE mason jars hit the table they were excited! I held my own taste test and concluded that Yelpers are always right and that the half & half rules. \n\nOur waitress was nice enough to explain some of the dishes to us. We ordered and waited a lil while... not as long as I did the first time I went. While we waited and talked the rest of the tables around us quickly filled and we considered ourself fortunate to have arrived when we did. I told them of the warnings about going to Lo-Lo's after church on Sunday... Expect an hour long wait! They whistled and said that it couldn't be that good... \n\nand then the food arrived...\n\nIt was better than I remember it! i chose the Soul-food platter which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken and your choice of two sides... I chose a waffle and smothered potatos and a large muffin type hunk of cornbread. My mom ordered the same thing but chose potato salad & yams as her sides. My cousin got a pair of drumsticks with a waffle. \n\nWe were all silent for a good five minutes. When we finally went up for air. My mom couldn't believe how good her yams were. She looked like she wanted to cry! lol... and she said the potato salad was great and that the chicken was EXACTLY what she wanted!!  My cousin was inlove with the chrunchy-type crispness salty sweetness of the chicken & Waffle combination. and I, I was about to DRINK my smothered potatos, which are nothing but simply boiled potatos swimming in this basil-thyme(?) flavored chicken gravy that was sent here from heaven!! IT was the BEST gravy I EVER EVER tasted!! I was happily taking a bite of chicken with a bite of waffle and then followed it with a nice perfect smothered chunk of potato... when... when... it was GONE!! ARGGHHH!! When are they going to invent never empty bowls?!?! huh?! WHEN?!\n\nThere was nothing but small micro bits of potato swimming in the most amazing grazy... and all I had was a fork... but there... was still some left... and not a spoon in sight, but I could pick up the lil mini bowl.... \n\n\"DON'T EVEN think about it!\" My mom scolded me while reading my thoughts\n\nDANG! \n\nI reached a happy medium when I got smart and skewerd a nice piece of chicken and dunked it in the gravy and I was SO back in business!! :D whoo hoo!! It was heaven. pure heaven. \n\nI know very few things about heaven... I know O'odham Cumbia in Heaven... and I know Lo-Lo's gravy is poured from FOUNTAINS in heaven!! haha.... \n\nMeanwhile - back on Earth, we devoured our food. I honestly thought I was going to have tons leftover for my lunch the next day... my mom thought the same... no such luck for any of us! My mom was in extacy over her yams that she asked for their recipe... the waitress said she'd ask and quickly came back with: brown sugar, cinnamon & vanilla - boiled and NOT baked... and that's it. And PLEASE let me tell ya'll - she has NEVER ever done that with me before... this woman doesn't like ANYTHING\/BODY... and that day, she fell in love with those yams! (Where's my calender?!)\n\nWe were laughing and talking about how good the lemonade is (oh yeah - when I needed a refil, I just asked for some lemonade instead of more tea, she did it no problem... she also did the same for my cousin who tried the red kool-aid) and how great the food was when I got a call from a good friend of mine. I told him where I was when he made fun of me and told me to clog my artaries... I made a face and asked him in a rather rude tone if he's ever been to Lo-Lo's, he said no. And then I told him... he'll never get how little I care about my artieries when I'm here until he tries it for himself! Only until you try it do you get how amazing it is...\n\nSo simple, so devine. So yummy, so Lo-Lo's.","useful":6,"funny":10,"cool":7,"type":"review"}

When I called they told me that they were extremely busy and not taking phone orders at this time. I enquired as to how long the wait was if I came down and place my order. I was told 10-15mins. I traveled from south east phoenix to central and Buckeye road location. When i arrived I had to tables ahead of me. I explained that I would like to place a to go order. The hostess proceeded with the customer ahead of me- which was not an issue. After waiting about 15 mins and 5 customers later i asked the hostess when someone would be able to take my order as I was on lunch, she told me that she had to find someone to take my order. I waited another 10 mins, So now I was 45min into my 1 hour lunch and not even an order placed. Needless to say. I left hungry and upset(don't play with my food). They didn't even notice. I called and place a complaint with the manager Mills. I explained everything to him and he gave me his personal cell phone number and told me to call him and he would make sure I was taken care of and that my next order would be on the house. About 2-3 week later I called and tried to place an order. When I spoke to Mills he made several bad management decision 1. He didn't handle my order personally he told me to call the main number and place an order. When I called the told me that they are only taking payment over the phone for call in orders, I explained to them that Mills told me to call and he would be taking care of my order, they said they had to verify this. 2.Mills then got on the phone and began to question me like I had made the whole thing up.  Stating did He tell me that he would take care of my order? Or are those my words? I explained the initial situation and 3. he said he remembers me but doesn't remember stating  the order would be on the house. He seemed hesitant and said well what would you like to order? I replied nothing and hung up. HORRIBLE customer service. I only wanted a Tre-Tre which was $7 (and nothing for me to pay). What a way to lose a customer. I was not out to get over or just cop a free meal. I wanted to know I was valued as a customer, and repayment for my time and gas I spent driving half way across town the last time I visited their establishment. I know that my order would not break LoLo's but their horrible customer service will. Because if this is how the do business I know there will be other customers who will not be returning to LoLo's. My co-workers wouldn't even order form there because of their previous bad experience with Lolo's and now I won't be returning either.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Now let's talk about this chicken though.  SO juicy.  Cooked PERFECTLY.  Seasoned to the T!  And when it comes out to your plate, it comes out piping HOT and FRESH.  Caution: you get A LOT of food!  Your plate is literally covered.  Which I had NO problem with it.  The sides, I was so torn as to what to get, but I ended up with the collard greens and the mac & cheese.  The collard greens were good, but not seasoned enough to me liking.  I had to add a little salt, some hot sauce, that helped, but I mean, I've had better from my mom and grandmother.  The mac & cheese was good, a little on the dry side, but good cheesy\/buttery flavor nonetheless.  I DO know one thing.

We had been back-and-forth yelping, and Lo-Lo's was something we knew we definitely had to try.... but we had no idea how to get there from ASU in Tempe. After trying for half an hour to use the Valley Metro Trip Planner (which gets a NEGATIVE 4 stars for being completely unintuitive and impossible!), we called Lo-Lo's and were immediately giving light rail and bus directions. \n\nAfter probably an hour and a half, during which we are getting hungrier and hungrier, and all our conversation is redirecting to fried chicken, we walk in the door and are immediately welcomed and told to sit whereever we like. We grab a table, and are offered drinks. I got a re-fillable jar of some of the best sweet tea I've ever had (although walking three blocks in 100 degree weather may have biased that opinion sometime), and we also got two ice waters to rehydrate. We looked at the menu and immediately knew what we wanted. I ordered the soul food platter, 3 pieces of fried chicken, cornbread, and sides of mac n'cheese and collard greens. Daniel ordered the Lil' Amadi, which was 1 leg and 1 thigh with a waffle, and a side of red beans (no rice). \n\nOkay. So. I don't like waffles. I'm used the Belgian waffles, which are way too huge and fill me up with bread taste and make me feel bloated. Lo-Lo's waffle blew me away; it literally was like buttery, slightly mealy, air. I kept stealing bites until I basically ate the whole thing, drenched in maple syrup and fluffy whipped butter. The red beans and collard greens were incredible! We both agreed that they were our favorites of the whole meal (two former vegans... haha): the beans had a touch of sweetness, simultaneously savory and tender. The collards had basically no bitterness at all, but weren't super salty. They were tender and cut into small slices that perfectly combined into a side-appropritate mouthfull. The mac n'cheese was pretty good but I didn't really focus on its taste. The chicken! Oh my god. I've never had breast meat that was still juicy. Incredible texture, the tenderness of the meat and the crispness of the skin juxtaposed. This place definitely blows Roscoe's out, and as a native LA-er, I'm sorry to say it. \n\nThe price is really great, less than 30 altogether, and we left a large tip because the service was so great! We felt so welcomed by the staff, and we could tell that they were having a chill time as well, singing along to Justin Timberlake in the next room. The only downside (not on their end) was that because of my slight cold, I couldn't taste all the flavors as well as I could have otherwise; that's the only reason this isn't getting a 5, and I can see myself changing that... I also cursed myself for forgetting my camera. I guess that means that I'll have to make another trip out there before I'm out of this desert.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Once we were sat we were greeted with a friendly waiter, I think his name was Joseph. \n\nI ordered the catfish and waffle and my wife had the #2 Baby Ray, basically 3 piece chicken meal with 2 waffles with gravy and onions. We also had a side of the Mac n cheese too. All in all I thought the food was outstanding!  Probably best friend chicken I've ever had.

We've heard rave reviews about this place so maybe that's the norm? \n\nAnyway. We went for my birthday breakfast around 11 and ordered Betty's Boob and Malaysia's Focheezy Juicy Hood Burger to kind of get a broader taste of the food. It was good, great even, but not perfect. For one, the chicken was a little dry and slightly chewy. Still edible and the seasoning was superb, but I wish the piece had been nice and juicy on the inside. The waffle was delicious. Wanted a little cruch on the outside there, but have no complaints about the taste at all. Together the chicken and waffles we very good. Then there was the burger which, same as the chicken and waffles, was very good all together, but the patty was more well than I ordered and needed some more seasoning. It was however a decently thick patty,  juicy and cheezy as the name states with lots of veggies and a tasty bun. \n\nWould return again, but like I said, at a hopefully less busy day\/time.

But I've never been much of a meat eater so I didn't eat if off the bone and have never thought to order it before. But coming to Phoenix this time my husband was craving his favorite lunch. He hadn't been here since the restaurant operated in the little house out back and he was a bit apprehensive that the food wouldn't be as good. He's was very happy that it was as delicious as he remembered. \nThe new restaurant is adorable. Very quaint with the rustic touches and decor but modern at the same time since it's relatively newly remodeled. \nTrace got his traditional chicken and waffles. And I got the boneless version. The chicken was succulent with a tasty crispy fried crust, not greasy. The waffle was delicious with butter and a great syrup which soaked in. Portion size was generous with a good price. I had to use skill to eat it all, because my mouth most definitely wanted to. And who can forget the sweet tea, served in a mason jar. Our waiter Jessie was super friendly and very good as his job keeping our glasses full. \nIt's now one of my favorite places too.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We drank sweet tea out of Mason jars. The menu had items named after characters from Spike Lee films. There was a \"Toy Toy\" and a \"Betty Boop\" in 'Crooklyn' right? I could swear there was a Sha Nay Nay in there somewhere.\n\nI was told I had ordered fried chicken smothered in mashed potatoes and gravy. Yes. Smothered. As in \"served as one entity\". According to Misty S, I tried fruitlessly to eat the aforementioned mad creation with a fork and knife, to try and give our lunch companion Erica O the impression that I was not, in fact, a gluttonous fatty without dignity, as my mashed potato-flavored chicken was trying to suggest.\n\nI had mentioned, before passing out in the car, that I found the waffles to be fluffy bundles of cinnamon joy. And that they tasted just fine without syrup, which was good, because I ended up getting most of my syrup on the damned fried chicki-mashed potatoes.\n\nThey had offered us dessert afterwards, which doesn't make any sense to me. If I had just eaten two syrup-less waffles and fried chicken soaked in mashed potatoes and covered in mis-aimed maple syrup, the last thing I'd expect is to be offered red velvet cake. But I'm sure at the time the idea seemed much more reasonable.\n\nThe food couldn't have been that bad, for though it gave me a \"food coma\" as the natives call it, I didn't suffer any intestinal woes.\n\nThe story sounded so fantastic and sensational I almost didn't believe. Surely I would've remembered dining in such a wonderland of soul food stereotypes. I was tempted to call Erica O and cross-reference Misty S' account with one of her own, but we were in the parking lot of Arrowhead mall and I needed a new pair of shoes.

Don't let the surrounding area fool you though, inside this small Soul food joint you will find some delicious eats. The inside of Lolo's has a very homey look and feel. Their menu is full of different Soul food fare. The coolest thing about Lolo's is that their entire menu is offered all day. If you want breakfast for dinner, you can. If you want dinner for breakfast, go for it. It's awesome!\n \nMy fiancé and I both ordered their KK's breakfast, which consisted of three pieces of fried chicken, two waffles (we both added pecans to our waffles), cheese grits and scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and onions. We also got a side of Mac and cheese, Yams, sausage patties and a slice of red velvet cake. My father ordered their fired chicken omelet, which was made with fried chicken, bell peppers, onions and cheese. Everything that we ate that morning was excellent. The fried chicken was really juicy and flavorful, especially the dark meat. The waffles were light and fluffy and packed full of pecans. The yams were really sweet and had a nice cinnamony flavor. Their sausage patties, which they make in house, were some of the best I have ever had. The Mac and cheese was really cheesy and gooey. The grits were also really cheesy and also really buttery. My dad's omelet was delicious. They made his omelet with four eggs and loaded it with juicy fried chicken (skin and all) and lots of grilled veggies. They also topped it with a ton of shredded cheese. The red velvet cake, which we took to go, was really moist. The cream cheese frosting, which was covered with pecans, was not overly sweet and was really creamy. To wash down all this yummy grub I had a huge glass of super sweet cherry Kool-Aid. My fiancé and dad both had their sweet tea, which was just as sweet as their Kool-Aid.\n \nThe service here was great. Our waitress was really funny and friendly. She was shocked to see us order so much food, especially at 10am. She joked around with us the whole time and always kept my mason jar of Kool-Aid filled to the brim. The prices here were great too.\n \nIf you like Soul Food and happen to be in the Phoenix area then you have to check out Lolo's. This place rocks!","useful":18,"funny":16,"cool":17,"type":"review"}

We walk to the back (chick'n coop) only to be told our table was not ready. So I sat down in the chair just outside the chick'n coop door only be to be told by the rude hostess (a Hispanic lady) that I could not sit and wait there I needed to go sit down in the front. As go sit in the front as I was told not even 50 seconds later I'm told you're tables ready. My husband had gone to the bathroom and I told the rude hostess I would wait for my husband to walk out of the bathroom before being seated so we could sit down in the chick'n coop together. The look she gave me said I was not supposed to do that. But I did anyways. We were seated and our waiter Steve I believe was his name came and got our drink order & after awhile our food order. I ordered the catfish my husband ordered the chicken & waffles. I asked for lemons for my catfish Steve never brought them to me I had to ask a table busser to bring me some. Steve came & refilled my husbands drink I still had some in my cup but by the time I was done Steve never came back another random gentlemen I think he was also a busser because I had seen him sweeping & cleaning off a table earlier. Offered to get me a refill, we revived our check & to go cups and left. The service was not very helpful or friendly in my eyes. The food was amazing I would only choose to go back for  he food.

You know that already based on the other reviews.\n\nWith that said, our experience here was terrible.  Here's how it went down: we arrive, put our name in and wait a very reasonable 10 minutes to be seated.  Once seated, we went through the menu and chose what to order.  10 minutes goes by.  Then 15 minutes - not a single staff member appeared.  We were being totally ignored.  I started checking Yelp for nearby restaurants and planning our escape from what looked to be an impending \"major fail.\"  Then suddenly our waiter appeared and was apologetic.  We were nice in return.  He blamed his slowness on a nearby table that was \"being difficult\" (tacky) and took our drink orders.  Another 10 minutes goes by.  Then 15.  Finally he shows up with our drinks and says nothing - just throws them down.  Weird.  He was having a bad night and we were paying the price.  Before he has another chance to run off, I politely tell him we'd like to get our order in.  He takes our order and runs off again saying very little.  25 minutes pass before he brings out the appetizer.  Then another 20 minutes later our entrees appear.  The whole time he's being as scarce as he possibly can and saying as little as possible every time he appears. Finally whilst eating our food another member of the staff (Susan) drops by and is quite helpful.  She refills our drinks and takes the long-devoured appetizer plate away.  She stops by several times to ask if we need anything.  Good job, Susan!  Unfortunately she turns our table back over to our original waiter who (after another unreasonably long wait) ended up bringing out the check.  He had nothing else to say.  Pretty astounding service for a restaurant that charges $20+\/plate (and - based on the mandatory Valet parking - would like to charge more).  As we looked at the final bill at the end of the (long) night, everyone felt cheated by the stunning lack of service.  I'm too nice to stiff someone on the tip, but I came darn close here.\n\nWe will not be back.\n\nIf you're in the area and need to spend $15-20 for some fried chicken and [carbs], go check out \"Welcome Chicken + Donuts\" instead.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The first occasion I ordered to go, I ordered ahead of time to make sure that it would be ready they said it would be ready around 12:20pm i got there at 12:10pm the food was already bagged up and sitting there cold the waffle cold and like rubber they might I add they forgot my cornbread and my waffle I had to go out to my car and look in the bag to notice they weren't in the bag after paying my $17.00 for it. I got to work I was on my lunch break and called to reach out to their manager who asks me to come back but I told him I only had a 30 min lunch and couldnt return until after 6pm and he said thats fine but wanted the food. I couldnt come by after work as I had to pick up my kids from daycare on the other side of town then he ignore my attempts to reach out to him until today 12\/6\/2015 I called him and he said he would not replace my food as they get calls like mine all the time and that he'd do something nice for us but not replace the food I said thats fine I'm coming in with my wife Ill see you in a minute. We get there are seated at 5:35pm we explain that I'd like to see the manager the waitress then says ok I will get him, she asks us what we want to drink we order a water and a sweet tea and we wait 15 mins for our drinks ready to order we see her help everyone else and even brings us napkins after 15 mins! and doesnt ask us for our order or even bring us our drinks! We had to ask a nice young man by the name of Jacquan who immediately helped us pt in our order, then the waitress suddenly shows up with our drinks and seems upset she says I talked to the manager and he just said he'd give you a dessert, so instead of confronting and greeting his guest he hides behind his staff and doesn't even come out and speak to us. Then the waitress who is now upset doesnt speak to us for the rest of the night. Meanwhile we wait and see everyone else already eating a person who was seated just before us already eating and almost done it is now 6:45pm and we have not even received our appetizer we ordered nor our food everyone is now leaving as they were closing at this time cleaning and putting up chairs around us. We finally receive our food and my plattter which includes cornbread, doesnt have cornbread they tell me that they are out of cornbread, wow so I come here already have a bad previous experience my food isnt replaced and to top it off they are out of the food I ordered. They then bring my wifes food which is a chili bowl and its frozen cold and has cold non melted cheese on top as if it had been sitting in the window until our chicken was done then they just threw some cheese on it, ridiculous.... To make things worst theres now only three people in the resteraunt they are paying their bills and we barely receiving our food now feel rushed as the entire staff keeps looking at us basicaly wanting to leave so we did'nt even get to enjoy our meal we just paid $30.00 for that was cold my wife didnt even eat because she didnt want to put in another order and make everyone wait for us as we already waiting an hour for cold food and no cornbread.... The chicken is great but they service needs to be taken up there should be a certain standards to the quality of service they are giving to their loyal paying customers.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

This is the place to go if you are feeling really hungry, or really under-weight. Where else can you get perfectly fried chicken with waffles?

I also thought it was very clean inside, which one would not expect from a restaurant that prides itself on serving neon colored and super sweet cool-aide. \n\nWhile the waffles are nothing to write home about, the chicken is fried to perfection. It was tough finding a parking spot, and we had to eventually park across the street. Not knowing if you car is going to get towed kinda made me rush through my meal. The grits left something to be desired - they were dry and had little seasoning. If it wasn't for the huge hunk of butter (which seems to be the only ingredient\/condiment that the kitchen used), I would have not eaten the grits at all.

However, our visit was good but not the 5 star experience we had hoped for.\n\nThe decor and theme inside is catchy and looks like what you would expect a great chicken and waffle joint to look like. The mason jar glasses and chicken theme along with the specialty Kool-Aide flavors is neat. Everything was neat and clean inside and the staff was friendly and pleasant. \n\nLong Wait and Slow Service\n\nThe wait on Sunday was 45 minutes for a table for two which is not that uncommon for a great food place on the weekend. However, it's still a 45 minute wait once we were seated we then figured out why the wait was so long. It was not the busy number of customers its the EXTREMELY slow service.\n\nWe placed an appetizer order and that took about 35 minutes for the catfish beignets. When they did arrive they were tasty and we enjoyed them. We placed our order not long after the app order and that took about another 45 minutes after the app. So all in all about an hour for our food to be delivered. We noticed many of the other tables were taking 45 min to an hour as well for their food. \n\nWhen a kitchen is making food fresh I know it can take longer to get out to the customer and is well worth it usually. However, an hour to serve chicken and waffles even fresh is excessive. If the kitchen could expedite faster they could reduce the wait times and turn the tables more quickly improving the customer experience. \n\nFood\n\nWe both ordered chicken and waffle dishes I added on scrambled eggs and my wife selected grits. The chicken was tasty and juicy with a nice crispy skin. The waffle was regular waffles you would get in a hotel thin, bland, and not crispy. The eggs I ordered they messed up the order and needed to replace them. I was impressed how quickly they took care of it and remade the eggs. The grits were cooked perfect and my wife enjoyed them with the cheese and butter. \n\nOverall I can see the draw people have with the location. The owner has done a great job of branding the business, creating excitement inside with the decor, and his staff is friendly. The only downside is the long wait to get inside, long wait for the food, and mixed up order. The actual chicken and waffles were good and very similar to other places I have visited around the country. \n\nThey are worth visiting and it is a good experience. If you visit on a non-weekend it might less of a wait as well. I hope you have the 5 star experience we hoped to have and others here on yelp have experienced.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

This is what the fried chicken in my dreams tastes like.  I always get the 3 pieces with 2 waffles and it puts me into food bliss state.  The last time I went there was a decent wait outside with the other two dozen people attempting to have lunch - this time was better because it was late lunch - my favorite time anyway!

We waited about 20 minutes, the staff was great & incredibly friendly. The food.. oh the food. Frankly, we were completely useless the rest of the day after our ridiculously delicious meal.  We both agreed that they were the best waffles and the best fried chicken we had ever had, respectively. The sweet tea was so good, as well as the corn bread with real creamy butter.

They took the time to help us find a way to the restaurant using public transportation(we were coming from ASU so we had to use both the light rail and bus system) when the trip planner had failed us miserably and would otherwise have left us stranded in 100 degree weather. \n\nThe space is very cozy and the table and chairs are very much something laypeople could own(wood - painted, none of that hyper-modern furniture here). It's not a super big restaurant so I imagine they could get packed very easily during peak business hours. \n\nThe food here is absolutely amazing. I got to try a few dishes:\n\n1. Lil' Amadi(waffle plus leg and thigh of chicken) - This is the best fried chicken I've ever had. The skin was not soggy at all and had a very nice crisp\/crunch to eat. The skin was not rubbery at all and gave away easily with a little resistance(which is nice, because super flaky skin is never good and a teeny bit of resistance keeps the skin together on the chicken). The skin to meat ratio was also good - in other words, I didn't feel like I was either eating nothing but skin or that they were being skimpy with the skin. The meat was extremely juicy and my girlfriend let me try some of her white meat and it is one of the few times(other than in Pho) that I've had white meat that is juicy. The waffle was also one of the best waffles I've ever had and I usually hate waffles. The waffle here was on the thinner side and had great texture. It was slightly crispy on the outside while maintaining a very moist inside - great texture combination. Also, the waffle wasn't soggy. This is key because I usually hate Belgian waffles because they're too thick, cakey, and tend to get soggy in the middle and are just plain gross. They give you a healthy dose of butter and syrup which made eating the chicken and waffles much more enjoyable.\n\nSoul Food Platter - My girlfriend and I basically ordered two dishes and tried eachother's dishes. The soul food platter allows you to choose between chicken or fish and a choice of two side dishes and corn bread. My girlfriend got chicken(three-ish pieces - sometimes I don't consider the chicken wing a full piece because of the higher bone to meat ratio than other parts of the chicken), collard greens, and mac-n-cheese. The collard greens were delicious! They weren't too salty like some of the other times I've tried them. They were also cooked just right - not too soft due to overcooking but not too hard due to undercooking. The leaves were soft and the stalk gave more solid texture to juxtapose with the leaves(but not saying that the stalk was hard - it wasn't - just more firm than the leaves). The mac-n-cheese was okay. I've definitely had better. To me, it was a slightly more gourmet version of the Kraft's mac-n-cheese. The corn bread was also just okay. It was on the more dry side and I ended up having to dip the corn bread in sauce because my salivary glands were running low on lubricant. \n\nRed Beans - These were delicious! My girlfriend thinks they cooked them with ham to give it a slightly smokey, salty taste and I think I agree. They're not too sweet which I definitely find to be a characteristic of cheap red beans. Lo-Lo's makes an effort to actually make their red beans savory and it's very evident. The sauce goes great with the cornbread as extra lubricant. \n\nIn regards to side dishes I recommend getting the collard greens and red beans. \n\nSweet Tea - My girlfriend says that iced tea is usually lackluster because it's just like drinking tea - except cold and that the defining factor to sweet tea is that it's sweet and refreshing - something cold drinks should be. I agree. The sweet tea here was divine and a perfect beverage to our meal and great to have when the weather outside was 100 degrees. Another big plus is that there were unlimited refills! It's served in a huge jar and we easily went through two of them. Amazing. \n\nOne regret I have is not trying the red velvet cake. \n\nThe food here is decently priced. It came out to roughly $27 for the both of us and we left extremely full and happy. \n\nThe reason why I hesitate giving Lo-Lo's five stars is because I'm not a veteran chicken and waffles eater, but rather, a recently deflowered chicken and waffles novice. Until I've had more chicken and waffles to compare to, I will hold off the five stars and just give four stars for now. \n\nI definitely recommend this place to anyone in town!","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Seriously?? \n\nThis morning, Dottsy, Robert M and I headed for SoDo (is that what the hipsters are calling the area just south of downtown?) for some chicken and waffle perfection. Lo-Lo's hits the mark on everything: my gravy and onion covered chicken was all sorts of awesomeness, the waffles were golden brown loveliness, the greens were bang on, the mac and cheese a creamy blissful experience, the red beans and rice were smartly appealing and the fried okra was splendid happiness. Sure, we ordered a lot of sides, but we wanted to be fair. \n\nLo-Lo's was like a religious experience--Sunday service was being played on the radio, there were babies crying, their food is also served in Heaven (or at least that's keeping me focused on the afterlife). \n\nAs well as being perfectly filled with some of the best food ever, we also had a marketing brainstorming session. The first was a tour of some great soul food restaurants using Metro and make it into a UYE. Its name? Pause for dramatic effect: The Soul Train.

Also, you can pick many sides from their long list of sides. I had their fried chicken legs and thigh and thought they were well seasoned although I wish they could fry it fresh. My pieces of chicken felt slightly room temperature and maybe they were left out for a while. However, they were still very tasty. Their sides were great too.

Once people got up from there the manager at the front rudely told us to pretty much move because we were in the way. We ignored the attitude and were seated shortly anyways. Our server took our drink orders and food orders so all good there.. Fast forward an hour and a half later, we still had not received our food. Keep in mind the place was semi full. So we finally said something to a man who appeared to be a manager and he offered to go check on our food. He came back 5 minutes later with our food. Now I've been a server so I could tell this food had been sitting at the window for a good while and I believe the manager said something to the server about it. Unfortunately at this point we had no time to eat the food since 2 friends I was with had to leave for their flight already so we asked for boxes and the check (both were promptly given of course). No one apologized for the wait or offered to at least comp drinks or my friends salad that had cold chicken and the wrong dressing all over it. Pretty disappointed considering I've always had a great experience here.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We headed in and were greeted right away. We didn't have a reservation, but we lucked out and got there earlier than the rush, so we were seated in a nice booth up front.  The place filled up pretty quickly after we arrived, so I would recommend calling ahead if you have a larger party (and they only seat your party once everyone has arrived, so keep that in mind, too).\n\nOur waitress was Leslie and she was wonderful from the very start.  Friendly and accommodating she allowed us a bit of time to look over the menu and made recommendations based on our preferences, which worked out nicely.  I had the Lo-Lo's meal and he had the Double D meal, we shared an order of cornbread, cause...who turns down southern style cornbread?? We opted to try out a couple of their drinks which I cannot remember the names of, but they were good! \n\nThe meals came out quickly an were exactly the way we ordered them and they smelled amazing. Chicken was cooked nicely and the breading was really well seasoned. Waffles were fluffy and perfect. The cornbread was gone within seconds of hitting the table. \n\nDespite being way too full for it, we shared a banana pudding for a dessert, which was worth every agonizingly over full bite! I highly recommend this if you from the south and like a good banana pudding with real slices of banana and wafer topping!\n\nOverall: A+\nGreat service, great southern food with hilarious names (amazing dessert for a bonus), and fun ambiance make this place a \"will absolutely return\" venue!","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

We found a fun looking place making a big success of the chicken and waffles concept. We thought it should be a light business that time of the week but soon discovered our mistake. This location seems to always be busy. By the time we were seated, received our food, paid our tab, and left it was 6:45 and the place was nearly empty.\nIn fairness there were nine in our party and a group like that doesn't just fit anywhere but it's still disheartening to watch people arrive an hour after you and get seated immediately. \nFood from the kitchen also was slow to arrive but, {and here is where the good news starts} it was very good!\nWe started with three appetizers, spicy corn fritters, fried green tomatoes, and fried green beans. I felt the beans were kind of bland but the corn fritters were tasty with the right amount of heat and the tomatoes were excellent.\nI had decided on a beet and after ordering 3 different kinds with all being unavailable I settled for a glass of ice water. My co-diners raved about the sweet tea and kool aid drinks.\nMost of my party ordered a variable of the signature chicken and waffles which we all enjoyed. My chicken tenders and waffle were very good. I like the breading and size of the tenders and the waffle was very tasty with a mound of soft sweet butter and a good syrup.\nI would recommend Lo Lo's and would give it 5 stars if the service {which was good} wasn't so slow and parking were less of a problem.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

You can park on the side street which we did but only after we waited on the single valet to park 2 cars that were blocking us. He was working hard but he was just the only valet there. Free but of course you gotta tip the guy. The chicken tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a bit or just wasn't made corrently. The homemade hot sauce is amazing. Like most down home fried chicken places they're a little expensive. We put in a order for the three of us to go and is was almost $50. Just standard 3 pc meals, not their most expensive plate options.

It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! \nThat's about where the love ends with this review sadly. \n\nWe were waiting for one other friend to arrive, they would not seat us until he was there, I have never had this issue at Lolo's. But wait we did. \n\nWhen we were finally seated the waitress took our food and drink order. 10 minutes goes by, no drinks. She comes to our table and says they are our of glasses and we have to wait for clean ones. We asked her if she could just put them in to-go cups, we didn't need the mason jars, she says sure. 10 more minutes go by. Finally out come our drinks, in mason jars. OI. \n\nNext up is the wait for the food. We literally waited an HOUR AND A HALF for our food to come to the table, and I believe the only reason why we got it then was because we had complained to the manager. The table that was seated 10 minutes after us, got fed up and left at about the hour 15 mark and walked out. A table next to us who had received their bill sat and waited a solid 20 minutes just to pay the dang thing! Our waitress completely ignored our table and section the whole time we waited. There were not even drink refills in that 1.5 hour wait. NOTHING. I got up and found a waitress and pointed out our table at the hour mark and asked how long the food wait was, she said 40 minutes, when I told her we were already well passed that she said she would find out what was going on. Nothing. Then our waitress walks by our section at the hour 15 mark we ask her what the hell is going on, we get no real response. FINALLY we are at 1.5 hours and we are ready to walk, our friend goes and finds the manager and asks him whats going on and to please come talk to us. 2 minutes later the manager comes to our table with food! Yesssssss only its wrong, BOO :( They delivered 2 orders of stupid fries to the table, when we told him we only ordered one he said well we are just going to throw this away so keep it, which I am glad we did because it was going to still be a while for all the food to come out correctly. My friends order was the veggie plate, 2 of the 4 sides were wrong, then they tried to deliver the same wrong veggie plate again. She finally gets all of her food. meanwhile myself and a friend are STILL waiting for ours. Then he gets his and the manager says so that's it right??? Ummmm no...how about bringing the pregnant lady her food, eh? \nMy food finally materializes and I am happy. The tell me that they are out of french fries but that they just cut up some potato's and made some fries, fine by me. My friend ordered the catfish and specifically asked the waitress for malt vinegar, she brings him out a cup of white vinegar....who does that? \n\nIve been to both locations plenty of times and have never had this type of experience. It was seriously the worst....and to top that all off when our bill came there wasn't one bit of a discount on it, after all of that, everything we had been through, nothing. we were pretty disappointed in how the staff handled themselves.

Second round, (still no chicken and waffles) eggs were much better but grits were underdone and watery.  When the chicken and waffles showed up, the waffles were already cool with no browning at all.  Coffee was terrible.  Wife's plate was just as bad.  Our original waitress never bothered to check on us until she brought the bill.  And to top it all off, the food is way overpriced, and over hyped!!!\nThe one solid was the chicken.  It was lightly battered and perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The scrambled eggs were real, not the fake crap.  I just wish someone in the back new how to cook them properly.

Since moving here over a year ago I have heard people go on and on about Lolo's chicken and waffles, especially when they find out I moved from the south. \"Oh it is the best soul food\", \"They have the best fried chicken I have had anywhere..\" are some of the things people have said. We live in Mesa and there is not a location near us but this morning  we were running errands in Phoenix and drove about 15 minutes out of our way so I could finally try this place that so many people have raved about. The place was decorated nice, it was not too long after they opened and it was not busy, we were seated right away. Took about 10 minutes before we saw a server, our drinks were brought out fairly quick and our order taken. Our food came out pretty quick but what difference does quick service make when the food is cold? The skin on the chicken was not even crisp on the edges, they had obviously been sitting around for a while. I tried a bite anyway, good fried chicken is good hot or cold and this was not good. It had the overwhelming taste of flour and I think the cook forgot to put seasoning on it at all. When the waiter came over to check on us I told him the chicken was cold and I didn't want it, at first he took the plate back and didn't say anything at all, when he brought the check he apologized. I have heard people say how good it is and maybe my experience is isolated but if it really was an uncommon experience then why didn't the waiter seemed surprised when I returned it? Why didn't he offer to get me a fresh plate? Why didn't a manager come over to see what they problem was or to apologize? Maybe they are used to serving sub-standard food, that is the only thing I can think of. This place reminds me of a lot of places that were really good until they got popular, quality of food and service goes down, prices go up and the only reason they stay in business is because they are \"cool\" or trendy. \n\nBottom line - Don't think I will try this place again, there are so many really good restaurants to try in the Phoenix area and when you are going to spend an average of $10+  per person to sit down & eat somewhere, the food should at least be fresh. \n\nOh yeah, one more thing, a glass jar of kool-aid should never cost $3, unless you get to take the jar with you.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I ordered the #10, which is two chicken legs and a waffle. The chicken was insanely buttery and moist, with perfect crispy crust. The waffle was short, flat, covered in butter, and accompanied by piping-hot syrup. That's exactly how I like it. \nI also asked our server for an order of her favorite side dish, and she brought me a side of collared greens, which were the best I've ever had. They were buttery, crisp, and somehow spicy. I asked one of the other employees how they got the spice, and he said it's crushed red pepper flakes, though he seemed unsure.

As it turns out, here in AZ, nothing goes better with fried chicken than crispy waffles!\nI have driven by Lo-lo's many times. Having enjoyed chicken and waffles at the famous Roscoe's in LA years ago, I kept meaning to give this a try. The only trouble is unlike years ago, I'm now trying to avoid fried food, as well as wheat so the concept of eating fried bird and fried batter was a conundrum to say the least.\nI decided after 6 months of staunch resistance to let my hair down and give Lo-Lo's a try.\nI went for lunch on a weekday. The place is directly south of downtown, in a fairly sketchy area. Despite the location, it was PACKED! It's always busy. Here's why:\nIt's billed as a soul food place however there were guys in suits and ladies out for lunch and families and singles like myself. Good soul food attracts a diverse crowd. Seems we might solve the worlds problems by having everyone discuss international conflict with a belly full of soul food. \nThe service from the moment I walked in was fast and friendly.  I got a table right away. My Server was a fun and spunky young woman named Jerri. She brought me an ice tea: huge mason jar! Seemed all the beverages are served this way to ensure no one needs endless refills. \nThe menu is colorful and tongue in cheek, with plenty of Ebonics word play. Being 25% black, I managed. Though my Canuck heritage kinda cancels any of that out!\nI opted for the standard 3-piece fried chicken meal with 2 sides. One has the gravy and onions option, but for my first visit I needed to taste the bird as it comes from the fryer! As I don't eat much carbs these days, I chose spicy collards and string beans with red potatoes.  \nThe food is delicious. It's not fancy. It's not trying to be something other than what it is: down home Southern delicious! The fact that most of the chicken and sides are ready to go back in the kitchen, I had my plate hot and in front of me in about 3mins flat!\nI chose to eat the cornbread as the heck with the carbs my black side wanted that bread! I poured out some of Lo-Lo's signature hot sauce, added a bit of honey and it was on like Donkey Kong! I savored every crispy, spicy, delectable bite!\nThe way I eat chicken is pretty simple: If I can chew or crunch it, it's going down the chute: skin, meat, cartilage, wing-tips, you name it, it's gone! I love eating chicken with my wife cuz I get to eat twice once she's done. \"You're not finishing that?!\" I inquire looking at what to me amounts a 2\/3 eaten morsel reaching for it...she has learned to simply look away and block out the chilling sounds of a carnivore devouring its crispy, salty prey.\nOnce I had finally eaten every possible scrap on my plate, Jerri came by and looking at the meager remains on my now barren plate, asked with a wry smile \"You gonna eat the bones too or are you finished?\" I said \"My only regret is that I don't have an extra stomach or I would order round 2!\"\nIf you want a real down home, down south, downtown fried chicken experience with our without waffles, get you DOWN to Lo-Lo's. You'll be back! \nI'm down.","useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Apparently a traditional southern recipe but one I'd not previously encountered I was told that these were best with a splash of Lo-Lo's \"famous\" hot sauce and although I generally prefer to avoid condiments I must say my neighbors were right as the acidity of the sauce really helped to bring out some of the more briny notes from the salmon while breading remained crunchy with minimal grease.\n\nMoving next to my main plate, the $14 Soulfood Platter with Chicken Fried Chicken, a golden waffle, macaroni and cheese, plus a round of cornbread it would be hard to find a gripe with this dish save for, maybe, those who like their mac n' cheese a little over-baked and with a bit of crunch.  Featuing a double dipped and friend boneless, skinless breast alongside a bowl of intense and peppery sausage gravy the chicken here was definitely the star of the show with each bite juicy and full of crunch but largely devoid of any oil whatsoever.  Nicely spiced and with the gravy further gilding the lily I next turned my attention to the waffle, also crisp but intensely buttery with a good amount of 'give' at the center and while pure maple syrup would have been ideal in the end the Mrs. Butterworth's was fine - the sweetness tempered by the chicken, gravy, and macaroni.  Last but not least, the cornbread crowned with a mound of butter was textbook - a little dry, not too sweet, and good both on its own or as a transition between the plate's other components.\n\nMaking short work of the Soulfood plate my primary server, Joseph, stopped by to say \"nice job\" and asking if I had room for dessert I think he was surprised when I said yes - and even more surprised when I ordered two; one for here, one to go, and both eliciting a slow whistle from the gentleman to my left who said to his wife \"that boy can eat\" - and much like the savories what I ate next would be outstanding.\n\nBeginning first with the lesser known of Lo-Lo's signature desserts, a house made banana puddin' served in a hefty mason jar and topped with an airy dollop of whipped cream - at $5 this is probably the steal of the menu as the container must have contained twenty spoonful of the rich parfait.  At times rife with the fructose of banana and at times mellowed by whipped cream or saturated Nilla wafers with plenty of textural nuance added by crumbles and chunks of unsoaked cookie this was precisely my kind of dessert; high end ingredients or not, I love pudding.\n\nRealizing I couldn't (or a least shouldn't) leave Lo-Lo's without trying their oft raved \"Sandy Sand's Red Velvet Cake\" and knowing I could (but shouldn't) have eaten it while I was still seated at 10 Yuma Street I asked for a piece to be boxed up and although it wasn't pretty, the results were just as good as many have suggested - the cake moist, dense, and loaded with cocoa while the cream cheese icing is slick but not too sweet and nicely tempered by the pecans.  Generally one to fancy cupcakes over sliced cakes mostly because I prefer there to be more cooked surface area and thus more 'sponge' I was particularly interested to see the open baking window as I left the restaurant where the team was assembling the cakes from large springform pans thus allowing the layers to each have more exposure and thus explaining the excellent texture.  For my money I'd go with the puddin', but this is one damned fine Red Velvet, and in the context of the experience that is Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles either make a great finale to a great meal in an unexpected but excellent setting.","useful":7,"funny":2,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

So my friends wanted to go after a long night of not eating. We had a 30 minute wait so we sat outside. We sat down and ordered our food. I got the KK's. Everything on that sounded good they give you 2 eggs also with cheese and onion and I asked for no cheese or onion. I also ordered side French fries. I got my food and noticed cheese and onions on my eggs I asked for new ones because I didn't want that. I also did not get the French fries I didn't bother asking I wanted to see if they would put it on my tab at the end. They brought out new eggs and they weren't even cooked. Like literally my friends were also disgusted. If you moved the plate you could see the egg white just bouncing around. It wasn't wear like it was just the yolk not cooked it was every part of the egg so I didn't eat it. The fried chicken is good and so are the waffles which why I was satisfied because of those but it's nothing to WOW about. I had a very bad experience and honestly this will not be my choice for breakfast. Also at the end my tab had fries on it so I told them I didn't get it the guy went \"oh okay\" and took it off but did not even apologize or anything else.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Stood waiting for 45 minutes and noticed people that came after us being seated so went up and looked at the waiting list and they had skipped us and been seating people after us with parties of 3 and 4 at tables with four chairs and left us waiting for one of the couple tables of only 2 chairs since there was only two of us. I got upset at the gal running the waiting list and she said \"you're next\" then proceeded to sit 4 more parties before us before we were finally seated at a table with 4 chairs since a table for 2 never opened up.\n\nThat was strike one.\n\nNext, with the name \"Chicken and Waffles\" I expected to have some good waffles and figured they would be BIG. I ordered 3 chicken wings and 1 waffle for $10.50 and was very disappointed when this little thin waffle came out with 3 little tiny chicken wings. I get bigger wings when be buy fried chicken at the deli counter of Fry's grocery stores. I thought about ordering another waffle but seen they wanted $4 for just a tiny waffle and said screw that. I walked away still hungry.\n\nThe chicken had good flavor but the waffle was tiny and soggy and a frozen waffle out of box would have been just as impressive as this waffle.\n\nWe were at the place for nearly 2.5 hours and the bill for two of us was right at $30 for lunch and both of us were still hungry when we left. Not worth the price or the wasted time to eat here. Our waitress gave us our drinks and took our order and we never seen her again until she brought me the check as a runner brought the food from the kitchen.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

No, you are the person that goes to Mastro's for the steak, Sapporo for the teppan yaki, and Red Lobster for the, well, red lobster.  (you know what I mean...)

My boyfriend isn't as into Soul Food as I am, but he ended up loving it as much as I did! We arrived around 11:45 on Saturday morning and there was a short wait to be seated.\n\nOnce seated everything happened very fast. Everybody who works here is very friendly and we were constantly checked on. We both ordered a \"jar of drank,\" Sweet Tea. It was really good. I could taste lots of honey in it. Yum! They also offer to go cups so I was able to take it with me when we left.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered Nay Nay's breakfast, two waffles, two eggs, and a bowl of grits. His waffles were delicious, loaded with cinnamon. Loved those. I usually don't like grits, but they were good here. There was so much butter on them, I don't know how somebody couldn't like them!\n\nI went with the Lolo's Famous Soul Food Platter, and I chose three pieces of fried chicken, mac & cheese, and smothered potatoes. This platter is also served with a piece of cornbread. I knew it would be way too much food, but I wanted to try it all. Everything was perfect! The chicken was super juicy, the skin was crispy and salty and exactly what I was hoping it would be. The mac & cheese was flavorful and very cheesy. The smothered potatoes were great, chunks of potatoes swimming in a very peppery gravy with some peppers and onions. And the cornbread was great too, very sweet.\n\nThe restaurant is bright and airy and they played awesome music the entire time we were here. The bathroom was very clean. The outdoor patio area was really cute. If I lived in Phoenix I would be here all the time! We were both really glad we stopped by here for lunch, we left full and happy. I am sure we will come here again whenever we visit Arizona.","useful":10,"funny":9,"cool":8,"type":"review"}

But that expansion should have warned us enough to try somewhere else. While the atmosphere and decor was phenomenal and fun, the food was not. I am becoming a chicken and waffles connoisseur as I travel, and these chicken and waffles should have been passed up. The waffles were flat and soggy, the chicken seemed to be microwaved, and not enough syrup was provided. I hardly use syrup so for me to be left wanting more was surprising.

We both ordered #3's along with the red Kool-Aid.

The waffles were the perfect compliment. The right amount of sweetness along with the heaping spoonfull of butter on top. The rice and beans were knid of put off to the side because of the \"main event\" but were tasty none the less.\nMy only concern was the sweetness of the Kool-Aid. I couldn't remember the last time I had Kool-Aid, but I never remembering it being this sugary. Maybe my mom had the right idea and only put 1 cup of sugar in to mix. What, the recipe only calls for one cup?\nThis was my 4th visit to LoLo's since moving out here last year. I was a regular at Roscoe's in Long Beach, CA and the only difference is in the waffle. Roscoe's puts cinamon in their waffle batter that gives it a unique taste. \nAlso, unless you have been fasting for a week, the #1 is a lot of food!

The waffles with butter and syrup was very yummy. Although I think I expected more waffle\/crunchy texture and not as more like pancake type of soft texture. But it's still good.

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted warmly and sat promptly. The menu was filled with many delicious options, but ultimately I went with the Chicken Fried Chicken, mac & cheese, and collard greens. Normally, I am one who immediately reaches for salt or pepper no matter the restaurant, except here. What's more, is that I didn't even realize that fact until I was nearly halfway done with my food. \n\nThe flavor profile of the dish was intense, I could tell I was dining on a old family recipe that had been passed down and updated over the years. The Kool-Aid was indeed large -- maybe even too large -- but very tasty. For dessert, I had the Red Velvet Cake, and that too was very scrumptious. The sponge was moist, and the frosting wasn't overbearing, but just the perfect punctuation to a well-crafted sentence.\n\nNow, I must be honest and say that the reason I am not giving the restaurant 5 stars is because I came back for Brunch the next day -- a Sunday. I was very excited to return, mainly to have the Biscuits and Gravy, and sadly, I was underwhelmed. Not only did it take an exorbitantly long time for the food to arrive, but when it did, it appeared as if it had been sitting under heating lamps for quite some time. Not to mention, the flavor profile was not nearly as intense as my previous meal there. Might I suggest to this establishment to start taking reservations. Not just for your patrons, but also for your kitchen, so that the line can be equipped, staffed and prepared for the monstrous crowds that flock to this otherwise great restaurant.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I've been to Roscoe's multiple times and wanted to see if it compared. Truthfully I was not impressed with this experience. Came with a party of 6 for Sunday morning brunch. We had an hour wait which surprisingly was a little bit faster then quoted  which was great. I got the chicken breast and waffle and a side of Mac and cheese which Is generally my usual at Roscoe's. The waffle was thin and smelled fresh and yummy. The chicken was in the small side which is fine for me seeing as I still had a whole waffle and Mac and cheese. When I tasted the chicken it was extremely dry. My sister's chicken wasn't as dry as mine, but still I was a little disappointed. With each bite I took I was in need of a beverage to wash it down with. Unfortunately, I got sweet tea and that was hands down the most disgusting sweet tea of my life! The saying \"Would you like some Tea with that Sugar\" comes to mind. I had to dilute it with water and even then I couldn't drink the pure sugar... We get it, you serve over sugared homemade drinks... But seriously, You're better off getting water or soda which both options contain less sugar then their sweet tea or kool-aid. Anyway, When they initially brought out our food they didn't bring out my side, I asked the waiter about the Mac and he apologized and said it would be out right away. A few minutes later he asked if I ever got it and said he would get it himself; in which he did and was super apologetic about it. He was a sweet guy. The Mac and cheese was plain, it tastes doughy to me, almost bland. The waffle was okay, I put light syrup and ate it, I don't have much to rave about for it was just a regular waffle... I still prefer a Waffle House waffle or Roscoe's... \nMy cousin got chicken smothered in gravy, I tasted the gravy and it was pure amazingness! I instantly wished I would have ordered it. The gravy tastes like bell peppers and other spices, very yummy! \nMy other family members ordered the chorizo plate which was a big serving alongside tortillas which everyone tasted and loved. Also, another family member got the biscuits and gravy. Another must, the serving size was big and the biscuits were on point! \n\nParking is.

Too lazy to walk, lol. It was steady and busy for a Sunday. The wait was about 30 minutes. Walking in though it was like a whole new atmosphere. The place was bigger than last time I seen it, so there was ample room. We got seated in the booth. I forgot who was our waiter, shame on me, but they were very pleasant and nice. We all ordered the smothered chicken and man it was DELICIOUS. It definitely hit the spot. The chicken even though it was smothered with the creamy gravy and onions still had a little crunch to it which was good still. I added some hot sauce to it and it just made this plate to die for.\n\nWaffles were hot and fresh. Poured some syrup all over it and I couldn't ask for anything more. Finished off all of the chicken, some of the gravy even made its way onto the waffles, but that didn't even matter because whatever was on that plate was just the right kind of balance of sweet and saltiness together. It definitely made my Sunday! OVERALL, with the new look and excellent staff, I enjoyed every minute of it.

We had an emergency stop at Wal-Greens for Lactaid, Tums, Bean-O, and Ginger Ale. I even made my bf buy this hideous stained glass candle holder (at WAL-GREENS) cause I thought it was \"cute\"-that is how out of my mind w\/pain I was. I laid down on the bed and asked for a barf bucket. Just in Case. And did you see what I gave this place? Yeah. Five muthaf'n stars. Don't be a pussy. \n\nI racked my brain all day, trying to come up with a good Phoenix-y place to bring my BFs dad who had driven all the way from Bakersfield and was surely hungry. We needed a place that at 8:30 on a Friday gonna be open and not insane. He is a down home, steak and taters guy, and I am a nervous nelly sophisticate whose lactose intolerance and mostly vegetarian tummy stumps restaurants . And I was hungry after a long day of work. I looked up the menu at work and saw they serve b-fest all day. Oh good, this way I could avoid all the meat, get the waffle, and avoid all \"oh, you don't like meat\" conversation I hate.\n\nEasy enough to find (take the 60 to 17 if you can to avoid Light Rail hell from the 10), we found parking on the street and walked right into the restaurant after seeing the bright neon sign with a mighty Sassy Chicken on front! We were seated immediately (I have no idea what people were talking about regarding the wait- we were lucky is all I can wager) in the same room Kristin C. was: the only four person table besides a two person one, where they have the soda machine, extra canola oil, cash register and silver ware and the kitchen where the amiable cooks sauntered out drinking sweet tea and eating the food. I liked the little hutch over our table with various black studies books. I liked the famous signatures tagged all over the place. \n\nI looked over the two-paged laminated menus-and was stumped. I forgot they had fish tooo....and sides...and omg. I guess the staff is used to a long decision making process, cause they hooked us up on the mason jars of sweet tea (holy shit is it GOOOooooOOOD). We all decided on the platter since it affords you two sides WITH cornbread, and the platter rings in only at $12.50 for battered chicken (3 pieces) or Codfish or Catfish with two sides and cornbread...whhaaaa-considering most sides are at like 3.50...I got the cod (go MA pride!), waffle, collard greens, cornbread. Tim got the chicken, waffle, home fries and his dad got catfish, waffle and homefries. After placing the order (I was gonna get fried okra but since the greens aren't cooked with ham, I went for 'em), it came within ten minutes-like FAST.\n\nWe all dove right into the waffle (I scooped off the butter immediately on to a separate dish in hopes of saving myself a little) and all agreed it was the best waffle ever.\n\n\"This waffle is good.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is\"\n\n\"Oh my...I just had the waffle and it is GOOD.\"\n\nfive minutes later\n\n\"This waffle is really, really good.\"\n\nten minutes later\n\n\"I can't believe how perfect this waffle is\"\n\nIt was like fucking Groundhog Day with this waffle, I couldn't picture a better waffle-not too doughy, not too nutmegy, not too crispy, not too buttermilky, not too cinammonly, not too eggy, not too airy, the little waffle indents weren't too deep or shallow for optimal warmed maple syrup lovin', and I ate the whole damn waffle. My lil' waffle of doom.\n\nI could only manage to eat one piece of Cod (it was as big as my face) and the crunchy, flavourful (but oddly not spicy) batter was perfect with the hot sauce on the table. The cornbread a moist muffin of pure delish-a real compliment, not a star, but a perfect compliment to the rest of the palate. I loved my collared greens and it was spicy, and vaguely sweet, and I ate it gingerly it was that good. In fact even thought I stuffed myself, I still had a whole piece of cod, a 3\/4 of a cornbread muffin, and almost huge bowl of collard greens left over.\n\nWe really wanted that red velvet cake so seductive under the glass dome case on the counter, but as we sat there drinking our refills, the pain started and the dreaminess and sleepiness and regret. \n\nOur guest loved it, kept complimenting me on it (and didn't notice my bizarre eating habits), Tim mentioned if he lived near by he would gain 5,000 pounds, and I can't wait to come back on a weekday early afternoon to have brunch w\/the waffle and GRITS...yummers!!!!!!","useful":11,"funny":13,"cool":11,"type":"review"}

I think I would have enjoyed my experience more if I hadn't been treated so poorly.\n\nThe place was busy when I came, but there was no wait and I was seated immediately. After being seated, I checked in on Yelp and waited for a server. None came. No one even acknowledged my existence. I looked at my Yelp check in time and 15 minutes had passed. I went to the hostess and asked what I needed to do to get a server. Rather than apologize, she made an excuse and said that the server was busy. I hate when people make excuses. Just apologize and fix the problem please. The hostess got me some tea and then the server came immediately. I ordered fried green tomatoes and chicken. Main course arrived almost immediately. Maybe 5 minutes after I ordered. The tomatoes, no where to be seen. I mentioned the tomatoes to the server and they showed up at my table when I was  halfway finished with the meal. I had planned on desert, I wanted to try the pudding, but the waitress brought me the bill before I was finished with the main course without offering desert. I asked her where I needed to go to order desert. She stared at me blankly and said, \"oh, you want desert?\" I told her no, it seems that it would be too much of a bother.\n\nI will never return. I think if I had gotten an apology for the service then I would have been a bit appeased. No apology was offered by anyone. Not the hostess, not the server, nor management.\n\nAs for the food, I think if I were placed in a blind taste test between Lolo's and KFC, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Maybe it's because the service left such a terrible taste in my mouth, but I will never return to find out.\n\nThe only positives to my experience was that I liked the atmosphere and the waitress kept my glass full, which is the only reason I tipped her.\n\nOkay, that's the end of my rant.

Their dining room is very small and sometimes there's a long wait at the door but their staff is always super friendly and there for you if you need anything.\n\nThings I've tried there:\n\nLoLo's special which is 3 piece of chicken with 2 waffles, Stupid fries, side of potatoes smothered, Chyna's honey hots (which are their hotwings), Ivan's chorizo and eggs, and their banana cream pudding.\n\nTheir chicken is perfectly cooked.  Nice, crunchy, juicy, and very flavorful.  Their waffles are fantastic as well, but my all time favorite has got to be their Stupid Fries.  It's a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers, onions, and chunks of their fried chicken.  I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered, it stays extra crispy under all that sauce.  That's what makes it so darn delicious.  It's definitely a meal in itself.  Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it.  Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing!!\n\nTheir koolaide are awesome as well.  You can't come here and not have their koolaide.  I love their blue but I sometime switch it up to red.  My fiance and I have tried their Scottsdale location as well but I feel that the cook at the Phoenix location (which is the original) has got it down packed.

Mostly due to the crap service I've received from the host staff. This last time I was standing in line to get my name on the list and somehow larger parties that came in behind me got put on the list before I was acknowledged at all despite being right there at the stand. I tried to say something, got a server's attention and not the hostess, she scribbled my name down on something, but it definitely wasn't the waiting list to be seated, so we left. Sorry I'm not a family of 7 and just a party of 2 (and white, I guess?).\n\nPrior, it's been the same \"I've got better things to do than help you\" attitude, mostly from the female staff. Servers and host. Male staff is usually fine, so I'm not sure why there's an attitude there. Friends that have gone before also have noted the attitude of the female staff and it's not a case of \"if everyone you talk to is an a-hole, you're the a-hole.\"\n\nFood quality can be hit or miss, too. Kool-Aid is far too sweet (universal across all locations) and I find myself ordering a water to dilute about 30-50% if I did order it. Breasts have been dry, except once. Thighs usually stay juicy, but I've had a couple dry ones as well. Pancakes are alright. Waffles seem like a pancakes in waffle form. Collard green are delicious. The banana pudding, though...

I had some mac and cheese which was great, so that made up for the waffle.  \n\nThe service was prompt and attentive, so no problems there.  However, I don't agree with the 18% gratuity for a group of 5 people, but I'm guessing it's to ensure people tip.

I asked what she recommended for a drink and she replied anything. Now I would have offered the most expensive drink they had. I was open for it. So I just ordered kool-aid. Which was the bomb. I once again asked what she suggested as far as the food goes. Once again anything was her reply. I don't even remember what I ordered but it was big portions. I eat a lot so I knew it was gonna take some effort. As soon as my food arrived not even five minutes later she was asking if I needed a check and a box. In my mind I was thinking I just got started. Now I was stuffed. I ate everything. Still had room for desert. But she didn't even offer so I was like well I better find another place to get some dessert.

I have never had chicken & waffles before and always wanted to try them since it made no sense to me. We went to the location on Buckeye and I was surprised to see how nice the restaurant was. Very clean, modern, well done. Service was great, felt at home right away. The current menu is a bit confusing with many different options but since I knew I wanted to try the chicken & waffles I ordered the Double D. The waiter suggested fried green tomatoes to start, since I have never had those I said yes! They were good too. Then the chicken and waffles came. Soo good! The batter on the chicken is perfect, I wouldn't change a thing! The crunch and spices are great. The flavor of the waffles were perfect and the syrup was not your standard store bought syrup, it added so much. Loved it. My 3 yr old daughter ordered chicken strips and a waffle, she devoured it. Since then she walks around the house saying \"Lo-Lo's!\" and \"I like Lo-Lo's!\". She want's chicken & waffles everyday now and I agree ! To finish our server suggested banana pudding, I expected some yellow jello-o like pudding, but got a gourmet banana dessert again with great flavor, full banana slices and some sort of crust in there that was awesome. It's obvious the chef's taste their food here, I really can't say enough about how well all the pieces tasted together. I will go back for sure, after I ride my bike, jog, or go swimming :) so many more new things to try, collard greens, shrimp & grits, red velvet cake...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The girls taking down names were Latinas.  The first thought that popped into my head was \"Where all the soul brothas and sistas at?!?\"  You can't have a soul food place, without the folks who invented soul food.  WTH?\n\nBut, alas, my fears were washed away.  Apparently, they were smart and showed up early, before Lo-Lo's opened, to get out of the heat and seated quickly.  Gotta remember that the next time because there is no waiting indoors.  You either gotta stand under a tiny 8x8 tent they set up or along the side of the building in the alley way.  So not cool, when it's already 100 degrees at 10am.  \n\nCan you see me sweating?  Not pretty.\n\nAfter a 35 minute wait, we were quickly shuffled into the a cramped little room.  Our orders were quickly taken.  Not even ten minutes later, the food arrived.  My \"Toy-Toy\" (two fried wings with a waffle) was delish!!  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Crispy skin on the outside, juicy in the middle.  Finger lickin goodness.  The waffle was great, too.  Slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  \n\nI have to admit, this place is waaay better than Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.  Though, I've been a fan of theirs for years, the quality has slipped and the chicken was, more times than not, overcooked.  They're getting kicked to the curb.  Lo-Lo's is now my favorite chicken and waffle place.  \n\nDespite the crampedness (is that even a word?) of the place, I'm still giving it a full 5-stars.  It's worth the wait and worth being up close and personal with your tableside neighbor.  Customer service quick and friendly.  Yes, it's a hole-in-the-wall place, but that's what makes it even more authentic.  It's unique, has a great vibe and great food.  Next time, I'm making room for some of the red velvet cake.","useful":8,"funny":5,"cool":6,"type":"review"}

I did not find it especially flavorful but did pick up on the baking soda. \n\nI was expecting a much denser waffle but found it to be thin and limp. \n\nThe mac and cheese was super creamy and had hints of cream of mushroom soup. \n\nNothing was really memorable for me, except the collard greens. For some reason, that's the flavor that remains most vivid. They had a delicious healthy greens flavor with a nice chili flake kick. \n\nSo, Lo-Lo's didn't knock my socks off but Lo-Lo's isn't really for me.

I had some friends visiting from LA and they wanted to try it since I always brag about how it is waaaay better than the infamous Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles. lol. \n\nA friend and I shared a soulfood platter. It was 3pcs of smothered chicken w two sides (we had mac n cheese & beans over rice). We had the gravy on the side and added a side of waffles. It also came with a peice of cornbread. I had the sweet tea to drink. The chicken and waffle were still as good as ever. The sides however were not very. Our mac and cheese was really mushy! The flavor was good but the pasta was way overcooked. It almost looked like a bowl of yellow custard. The beans and rice also had great flavor but the rice was a bit undercooked. The cornbread was better than I remembered. I noticed they changed their gravy also. The color is different... more golden than before with little specks of something red. It used to be a light brown gravy with peices of wilted onions. While still good, I liked the old version better. The sweet tea was a little sweeter than normal but I still enjoyed it.\n\nMy friends agreed that the sides could've been better but really enjoyed the chicken and waffles. They enjoyed it so much that they wanted to go again before their trip back home.

I hate to denigrate the original, but Lo-Lo's takes Roscoe's formula and runs away with it.\n\nFirst, their chicken is very, very good. Crispy skin, moist interior, just the right amount of spices. My only beef is I wish the pieces were slightly larger.\n\nSecond, the waffles are excellent and topped with an enormous round of butter. Just they way they should be. Crisp, dripping with butter, delightful.\n\nThird, the sides... oh, lord, the sides. The collard greens are the best greens I've ever eaten, and I've had my fair share of good ones. Cooked perfectly, no bitterness. They make the south proud. The cheese grits are a bowl of cheesy, well cooked goodness and are not to be missed. The mac 'n' cheese was smooth, and bathing in cheese sauce (and did I detect some velveeta in the mix? oh, I believe I did! And this, my friends, is a very good thing), and the cheese eggs were fluffy and perfectly proportioned between eggs, cheese and onions.\n\nFinally, the red velvet cake is an absolute must-- no matter how stuffed you may be. If I could be encased in the frosting I would die a happy young lady.\n\nMy only regret in going to Lo-Lo's was my lack of stomach capacity. Now I'll have to wait a year before I try their fish, peas, and other sumptuous looking offerings.\n\nWord to the wise-- as other reviewers have said, get there early. The folks who run Lo-Lo's are nice as can be and get your food to you in a hurry, but the place is small and it fills up quick. We were in by 10:30 on two separate weekdays and got the last available table both times. Otherwise, you're setting up outside in line. And while Lo-Lo's makes the waiting as nice as possible, with a shade tent and water, who wants to stand around drooling over the smells coming out of that kitchen?","useful":8,"funny":3,"cool":4,"type":"review"}

Hole in the wall shack on the corner of a busy street across from a fenced up empty lot. There goes the ambiance.  \n\nActual Restaurant: Too small and cramped. Very mediocre looking. Lots of signage written in Ebonics, menu items had ghetto names, Kool Aid flavors (Who puts Kool Aid on a menu and charges $2 for some colored sugar water?!) were Blue Raspberry, Tropical Punch, and Red....WTF is RED?!  \n\nEmployees: Cordial. Wouldn't say friendly. One copped an attitude when I told her this place was just like Roscoes.\n\nThe Food: I had the Sheedahs Special (1 breast 1 wing 1 waffle) and a side of Mac and cheese. The chicken was very salty. Salt does not equal flavor. The waffle was DELICIOUS. Just like Roscoes. The macaroni and cheese I was appalled by. How dare someone use cream of mushroom soup to make Mac and cheese with! That's a cheap way to make it creamy. I was sickened. 2 bites and I was done.\n\nMaybe I'm just spoiled by Sistahs Soul Food in Long Beach or the REAL chicken and waffles joint who've I've named several times already but I couldn't see what all the hype was about.

Southern fried chicken and waffles, grits, collard greens, and sweet tea in a mason jar. As I ate, all I could think was, \"Thank you, Jesus.\" The ONLY thing that was a little disappointing was the catfish, a little too thin and a little too dry.

The chicken was cooked perfectly--tender and juicy with a crispy coating that had a nice \"pop\" of seasoning. The mac n' cheese actually had cheesy flavor. All too often, restaurant mac n' cheese leaves me wondering \"where's the cheese?\" Not so at Lo-Lo's. The only (only!) complaint I have is the portion size. It was WAY TOO MUCH!

I'd heard about it from others like some sort of ancient mythology - it sounds amazing and fantastical but you know it can't really be true.  When it comes to Lo-Lo's - believe the hype.\n\nFinding Lo-Lo's: I've driven down Central SO many times and never known how close I really was.  Then one day I saw an arrow spray painted on the side of the building.  \"Lo-Lo's this way!\"  It took a few minutes to realize that that must be THE Lo-Lo's.  I started talking about it w\/ friends and we decided we needed to go.  I confirmed the address and the 3 of us set off for flavor adventure.  Yes, you turn at the arrow (Which you only see when driving North on Central) and it's not much at all past that - but don't expect any huge signs, valet service - or even a parking lot.  You'll park right out on the street - and on a busy night that means you may need to walk a bit.\n\nEntering Lo-Lo's:  Stepping through the doors = Waiting area.  Taking 2 steps into Lo-Lo's = Standing in front of someone's table while they are eating.  You can tell this used to be someone's house - and it was a small house at that.  There are just a few \"rooms\" for seating - and the largest has 5 tables.  Our first time there we sat in the room that has just two tables - a 4 and a 2 top - but it's also where the cash register is, where folks pick up to go orders, where they refill the drinks\/silverware, where they store extra items that were purchased in bulk and has the doorway to the kitchen and you have to walk through that room to get to the other rooms.  In some places you might think this was the worst table in the house.  At Lo-Lo's I would disagree with you.  We got to listen in on the best conversations and we had the best view of all the amazing food going to the different rooms.  \n\nThe Food:  Sweet Tea served in a big Mason Jar.  SOLD!  It was awesome and the refills kept coming.  Soul Food without Sweet Tea is just wrong to me.  As for the rest of the Menu - it's not 30 pages long - in fact I'm pretty sure it's just one piece of paper written on both sides.  And yet it's still SO hard to choose.  The first time we went each of us got something slightly different.  Both my eating companions got some version of a meal that included both Chicken and Waffles.  I bucked the trend and got their Salmon Croquettes with Cheese Eggs, Grits and Waffles.  I could talk for days about how amazing their food is.  Best Eggs I'd ever had.  I am not a big egg person and I was craving these eggs again for a month.  The more I think about them the more I want to go.  The Salmon was amazing - I took one home and it was big enough I made myself a sandwich with it the next day.  The sides are all absolutely amazing.  The Greens have an amazing sweetness aftertaste that I am completely unable to describe.  The Chicken.  Oh, the Chicken.  Let's start w\/ this.  I've always thought fried chicken was \"ok\".  I went with 2 folks who love fried chicken - and make their own family handed down recipes.  After their first bites it looked like they had found the holy grail.  It was the best fried chicken I'd ever eaten.  Guess what I've saved for last?  The waffles.  I always eat waffles or pancakes last for 2 reasons 1) They are SO sweet just like a desert and 2) I can only eat a few bites worth.  They are usually too sweet, too sticky, and very quickly mushy.  So, I spread around the butter (removing most of it of course) and drizzled it with some syrup.  It was the lightest, yummiest, buttery heavenly thing I'd ever had.  These were not just waffles.  These were Waffles.  I ate almost the whole thing.  As for Lo-Lo's desert menu - I've heard great things about their Red Velvet cake - but I've never quite been able to get that far into my meal and still order more.  Maybe next time.\n\nService: We've always had great service.  Servers are usually young and have that \"I'm working at my uncle's restaurant for the summer\" quality - but they are fast, knowledgeable and quick on the refills. \n\nAtmosphere: If you are from certain parts of the valley - Lo-Lo's may be a bit of a culture shock.  Yes, it is quite possible if you are of the Caucasian persuasion - you may be the only one there during your entire meal.  I've heard some folks say they would be \"afraid\" to go because of that.  My thought?  Get the heck over it.  Should a black person be afraid to go to AZ 88 or Flemings because they might be the only black person there?  Heck no.  And wouldn't you think they were silly for even thinking it?  Exactly.\n\nOverall: Prices are good.  I honestly can't remember how much anything costs.  I blame the food.  But I do remember thinking \"wow, is that all?\" every time we go.  Location is downtown - just minutes from AWA.  Food is out of this freaking world.  Calorie content is... well...  it's not something I like to think about.","useful":8,"funny":7,"cool":6,"type":"review"}

The portions are crazy big and might satisfy GODZILLA.\n\nLong Story-\nThis pack was PACKED with people early at lunch time. The hostess informed us that it would be a half hour wait and her prediction was very accurate as it was. We ordered and our server brings out our beverages in large canning jars. We wait and wait and then our server informs us that the kitchen is backed up and it will be a while for our food to arrive. So we wait and wait and were are real hungry by now. Our food does eventually arrive sometime after a half hour.\n\nI received a soul food platter. You have many choices on how to build your platter and I picked a chicken thigh, a fish, and two sides. This platter also comes with a corn bread.\n\nChicken- Good! Crispy Skin, Seasoned Nice, Moist!\n\nFish- Awful- Served broken in half, over cooked with a terrible ultra thick corn meal coating that might have been a 1\/3 of an inch thick. \n\nMacaroni and cheese- so-so-better than average for processed tasting cheese. Strong process cheese taste but doctored up well. Pasta was slightly over cooked. I note that I don't care for processed tasting Macaroni and Cheese. I know that most people only eat and make it that way so you might feel different than me depending on your taste.\n\nSpicy Green Beans with Red Potatoes- Not Good- The green beans seemed almost canned. The beans might have been frozen but were very grey and over cooked. The potatoes seemed either steamed or boiled. They were not appetizing at all.\n\nCorn Bread with GIANT ball of soft Butter- Good- sort of cake like, a little sweet and studded with corn. Tasted like a mix of cake with cornbread with LOTS of butter soaking in. It was like having a rich dessert. Also giant sized. You will hurt your self if you eat the whole thing.\n\nMy husband had the #3 Lo Lo's Plate. It cost $2.00 less than my plate and was a much better value. He had three pieces of chicken and waffles. I tasted a small piece of waffle and it was good.\n\n\n\nBetween the wait, The not so good fish, processed tasting macaroni and cheese and the not appetizing spicy green beans with red potatoes and the $42.35..brought things down for me.\n\n\nIf you stick with only the things that Lo Lo's does best you will do better than I did.  Go there when you are monstrously hungry.\n\n3 Stars according to Yelp means A-OK and worth a try. \n\n\nI give three stars when it's a mixed review with some reservations.","useful":2,"funny":3,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

The quality of the egg cookery varies quite a bit, and so does the red velvet cake (the last time I had it, it was burned). \n\nWill any of the inconsistencies keep us from returning? Hell no.

I've only been to the Scottsdale location, so it's a bit too \"clean\" for my taste, but the food is a real treat.  Good break from the usual Mexican, chinese, pizza, etc.\n\nFried chicken with Gravy and Onions is my favorite.  Chicken loses some of its crispiness smothered in gravy, but that's a worthwhile trade off.  Sides are either really good or mediocre.  Avoid mac and cheese.  Very disappointing.  Red beans and rice are excellent. Collared greens are the best by far.  Spicy and hearty.  I'm not a big fan of grits, but they were creamy.  Service was a bit slow.  If you're planning on going during spring training, be weary of going after a Giants game as Lolo's is right down the street from the stadium and once the game's over, it gets really crowded and the service slows down more than usual.\n\nKool-Aid served in jugs?  Does it get any better than that?

It's a corner restaurant and wasn't difficult to miss with big enough signs.  \nThe parking lot at the side of the restaurant was on the small side and packed.  Thankfully at the time of our arrival a couple of people were leaving so we got lucky to snag a parking spot.  There's a parking lot across a small street opposite the restaurant which I believe can be used to park as I saw other patrons parking there as well.\n\nThe restaurant had plenty of seating both inside, what looked like a back area, and an outside area though there weren't any folks dining outside due to the hot weather but the misters were on.\nThe restaurant was clean and well lit from light from the outside and inside.  \nNoise levels was high with all the dining folks, and I believe there was music playing in the background.  Large screened TV's adorned the walls but were on mute.  The walls also contained paintings and pictures of various musicians and stars.\nMy suggestion for an arrival time would be early.  We arrived at\/around 1-1:30 in the afternoon and there was a wait of about 30 minutes plus the waiting area was packed with only standing room left.\nThere's only one entry point into the restaurant from the parking lot and that would be on S Central Ave itself.  As you enter, you're greeted by staff then you provide them with your name and how many are in your party.  \nIf you choose, you can wait around by the door as most people were doing if the one couch they have is occupied or wait outside as I also witnessed folks doing.\n\nMenus - while you wait, you can grab a to-go menu (many copies available) to have a gander of what's on the menu as it was similar to the real one that's provided when you're finally seated.\nWhen you're seated, you're provided with a 4-page colorful, self-explanatory menu that also contained drinks and desserts as well (can't remember if I saw that on the to-go menu).  \n\nService - All staff, from the folks that greeted us at the front door to our waitress, was super friendly.  \nThe waitress explained everything and asked if we ever dined there before.  She provided suggestions of the favorite dishes that folks ordered and checked on us periodically throughout our stay.\n\nFood - For me I ordered The Famous Soulfood Platter which came with your 1 choice from eight items plus two sides and it came with a cornbread.  From the 8 items, I chose the 3 pieces of chicken (Southern fried).  You can opt for random pieces or you can pick which ones you want.  For me, I went with the leg, a wing, and breast.  For my 2 sides, I chose the mac n' cheese and the rice with beans.\nThe wifesky, ordered The Cool Bre Bre's Chicken Salad (field greens, white meat chicken, candied walnuts, cherry tomatoes, avocado, applewood bacon & your choice of ranch, raspberry or balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing) and it was huge!  She almost didn't finish but she managed to push through.\nFor my meal, first the sides - the mac n' cheese - served in a small bowl but was of a heaping portion and wasn't too dried out and sticky, and wasn't too runny either.  It was done just about right because you can't have mac n' cheese done too runny or too dried out in my opinion.  \nThe rice with beans was to die for.  My only regret was not ordering another side of it.  The rice was well cooked and fresh plus the beans...not sure if it was red beans because it didn't look like baked beans was done to perfection!  It was well cooked and the sauce\/gravy it was served in was nicely seasoned with a small kick to it.\nThe chicken was moist, tender, succulent, fresh, and cooked perfectly.  It was well seasoned and the fried skin\/batter wasn't overwhelming so it had enough bite\/crunch to it.  The chicken wasn't too oily\/greasy \nIt was truly Southern styled, comfort food!\n\nDefinitely would love to come back to try those oversized Belgium waffles I was seeing on other folks plates!  You truly won't regret your visit here!","useful":27,"funny":13,"cool":18,"type":"review"}

They're more savory so it goes with the food. If you've never have had grits the first place you should have them is here. Collared greens, fried okra, and the mac and cheese are soo delicious. Cool-Aid? Yes, yes, and yes. It comes in this big ice cold pitcher!! The Red Velvet cake is a true Southern delight, and being from Texas, I think it's perfect. Also the Chrizo is ace!!!

I'm not a big waffles fan but how could you not love that big dollop of butter siting on top.  The gravy was very delicious, and  the onions were a nice touch.

This restaurant was suggested to us and we were so excited about getting some good ol Southern Food. I truly would have given 5 stars if I was basing this review on food alone. However; this review is based off our entire experience.  First let's starts with the \n\nPros: the front door staff\/ hostess where extremely friendly and were able to seat our party of five in a decent amount of time. The food absolutely hands down delicious. The chicken was moist and perfectly fried to perfection. My collard greens had the right amount of flavor and heat to taste. Don't get me started on the waffles omg AMAZING. I truly enjoyed my food so to the cooks GREAT JOB.\n\nNow on to the \n\nCons: our waitress Edith although friendly was not that attentive. I ordered the catfish appetizer and specifically requested it come out prior to our meal.. well that never happened because our food came out before the appetizer. I had to let her know that I no longer wanted it because it was late coming to the table. Also she rarely returned to our table after our orders came out and seemed like other waitstaff was picking up her slack. She forgot or it just took several minutes for her to bring things that our party requested back to the table. For example I order sweet tea which I didn't get until I wad half way through with my meal. Once finished we requested some Togo boxes and a bag which the boxes came out but no bag then had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the bag and check. \n\nAfter paying for our meal and getting back home I noticed I was still charged for the catfish appetizer. I called the restaurant and was told to hold while they get Edith on the phone. Once she got on the phone and I explained my calling she said to please hold while she gets the manager to adjust the charges to only be hung up on. I called back and then was reconnected to Edith and was told to hold again while charges are reversed. I waited on hold for about 10 to 15 minutes when finally was told charges had been adjusted. I am just hoping in the few business days it takes to show the reversal on my card that it actually does. \n\nAll and all I loved the restaurant, food, and friendly atmosphere. But didn't care so much for the service received.  I would definitely recommend coming here to eat and enjoy the soulful cooking.  Just note that some staff training maybe needed.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Back then (although my memory fades), the shack was still there and this joint was in it's infancy and both the atmosphere and food were memorable in that fried, greasy, backwoodsy kind of way. It had charm and character, but now the shack is gone and larry has gained about 25 pounds and they have two locations and there is exposed lighting and nice booths and T-shirts for sale. Hey, when the cash gods give you your chance to cash in, you might as well, but some places don't sell out and its too bad that this place has fancied itself up. The food though was pretty much what I remember, although Waffle House has better, crispier waffles. The chicken is still top quality, but not the \"best ever\" anymore, hey something has too suffer when your expanding. The home fries were outstanding with huge chunks of real potatoes and a healty dose of onions and two colors of peppers on top and the sweet tea was terrific in it's mason jar for 3 bucks. It's still clearly worthy of a visit by tourist and local, but if your in a real good fried chicken place in the South, you will wait 25 minutes for fresh chicken. My meal came out in ten minutes which leads me to believe things are a bit different in that kitchen these days than the good ole days gone past.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I have been coming here since they had the little house they operated out of. On the basis of their food, they deserve 5 stars. I deducted because of parking, the hostile lady (mentioned by another Yelper, who also posted her photo), their insistence that people wait outside and the lack of adequate parking. I think that the parking and wait area issues needed to be addressed during the planning stages of the expansion\/remodel. The place is beautiful, but lacks key components: a place for customers to wait (they have a patio with a misting system, but this may not suit everyone) and to park their vehicles. The hostile lady needs to go. That is a HR issue. Please don't tell people to wait outside in 100 degree plus weather.  On the bright side, they are so busy that they need more room ( add a second floor and acquire more parking?). I will park in the sketchy neighborhood, ignore the hostile lady and try to wait inside for their delicious food, but not everyone is willing to run a gauntlet for a meal.

We ask for the manager. Carlos comes over and says it would be 15 minutes for greens and there won't be a problem.  Carlos then comes right back and says it will be an hour for greens. No apology no type of compensation for the huge issue. So we suggest a complimentary margarita in the meantime and Carlos looks at us crazy and says \"on the house\" like it was an unimaginable request.  After he dismisses the suggestion he  tries to sweet talk us into string beans. We agree. 25 minutes later we notice two tables seated AFTER us and one has greens. We then call Carlos over and tell him what we have recognized and he argues with us saying we haven't been there an hour because the waitress put the order in 25 minutes ago and it was placed after the two tables that arrived after us.

Typically the restaurant is pretty loud during busy hours. Also they have a live DJ who mostly appropriate music that all guest can enjoy. The restaurant has a country\/industrial theme. The outside seating area is nice for when you wait, which is almost guaranteed if you come for dinner especially on weekends. A big bonus is the restaurant has valet parking that is free (but please tip). I suspect it could be because the fence on north side is always being hit by customers. The parking lot is not large enough to accommodate the restaurant when at full capacity. Addition parking is on the neighborhood streets or across the street and industrial building. Most of staff are young and spirited. Service: it's not what I wish it would be. Food comes out at various times, which can be annoying if you get your food and you party gets theirs 15 minutes later. This seem to be more so with parties of 4 or more. The managers are pretty stiff and rigid. Definitely not \"the customer is always right\" type. They are not friendly and spunky like the waiters.

It has been a steady decline for quite some time now, until today, which has made me write them off entirely. They now refuse to take a cash order over the phone (mind you we are in an office ordering for a dozen people all who have cash). Their customer treatment is very poor and at times downright aggressive. The parking lot is valet only so you are forced to park somewhere in the neighborhood behind the building and walk or pay up. I would strongly recommend to pass them by if you are in the area and support the new Welcome Chicken and Donut that is right down the street. You will pay just about the same, the quality of food will be better and the treatment you receive will be a world apart from the sad franchise Lolo's has now become.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I will never return to this location. \n\nThis is the third and final time I will set foot in this location. Todays encounter was by far the worst. My mother called in a to go order because she figured it would be busy. When my son arrived we stood at the door as there were several people waiting to be seated. I received a text from my mother informing me that it would be an hour for the order to be ready. I looked around and there were several empty tables in the middle of the room, 2 empty booths along the window and the banquest room was empty. I approached the counter and asked the hostess if it was really going to take an hour to get a to go? She replied yes, we have people sitting at tables that havent had their orders filled in 30 mins or more. i directed her sight to the multiple open tables and asked for an explanation. She said \"OBVIOUSLY WE'RE BUSY\"!! I then asked to speak with the manager, whom happened to be walking up. I stepped to the side to address the manager. I informed the manager that this was my 3rd attempt at getting a to go order. I explained that my family and I go to the Scottsdale location very often. From the start the manager was very condescending. I informed him of my most recent visit to simply get dessert,(Which on that visit I was informed that they were'nt doing to go orders because it slows down the kitchen. But they would see if they could get me a slice of cake)! After explaining my frustration to the manager his reply was simply \"oh well\", while staring blankly into my face. I asked the manager for his name which he gladly offered while extending his hand, \"I'M LARRY WHITE, THE OWNER... I AM LoLo!' Raising his voice and gripping my hand as if to intimidate me! I shook his hand as he squeezed like we were at some stand off in the playground, childish attempt to display authority! I politely informed Mr. White that there was no need to attempt aggression and raise his voice. I reminded him that I was calm and the tone in my voice had not changed AND I would appreciate it if he would not attempt to disrespect me in front of my 4yr old by raising his voice to me. I thanked Mr. White and requested that he cancel my mothers to go order request. \nAs mentioned, my family and I are loyal patrons of the Scottsdale location. It is really sad that the level of service is not the same. But here is a suggestion, maybe if your kitchen staff cannot handle the level of business that you do, HIRE MORE STAFF!!! Or better yet, turn down the music and have the DJ help out! It's a restaurant not a night club. But I am not a Business Major so maybe I don't know from what I speak.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Not bad - I like it.\n\nOkay - so this is the millionare dollar question: How's the Lo-Lo?\n\nI think it's just okay, I don't see what's so special about it. It's just a big piece of waffle, it's not especially crispy or anything. It's soft and soggy. If you like your waffles like that, then maybe it fits you better than for me. The fried chicken was definitely crispy so that's good. It wasn't flavorful though. It just tasted deep fried. I think KFC and Churchs chicken taste better. I rather buy KFC or Church chicken and make my own waffle with my waffle machine and eat it. \n\nIt's a little bit on the saltier end for the chicken but it didn't bother me too much.\n\nThe service here can be nice but when they are attentive, the wait staff is extremely courteous and kind!

We were only made to wait for a short time before we entered the shrine of soul food. We were greeted very warmly and asked what we wanted to drink. I had the sweet tea. I usually LOVE sweet tea but they were not messing around! Next time I'll order 1\/2 sweet and 1\/2 regular tea. For my meal, I got the 2 piece and a waffle. We chose several sides to share between the three of us. We had the red beans and rice, mac and cheese, collard greens and fried okra. \nI was amazed when the food arrived at the table. The waffle was hanging off of the side of my plate and smelled like heaven probably should! I tried the fried chicken and I was taken back to my childhood. The chicken was well seasoned and has a bit of baking powder bite to it! AMAZING. It wasn't at all greasy or soggy in any way. My mouth is watering just typing this review. In the background, there was great gospel music playing so I hope that getting a dose of Jesus while eating fried chicken might banish any of its artery clogging properties.... yeah.... \nWe were checked on several times to see if we needed anything and we were treated cordially. I will visit LoLo's any time, any day as long as someone is there to share the guilt with me!","useful":8,"funny":6,"cool":6,"type":"review"}

Though most people go for the chicken and waffles, I much more prefer their smothered chicken with hash browns, collared greens, and sweet yams.  Be forewarned -- the smothered chicken is salty.  Much saltier than most people would prefer, tbh, at least if their palate is fairly \"white\" (as in not eating a lot of spices and salt and whatnot).\n\nThe sweet tea is always phenomenal and the red velvet cake is comparable to stuff I've eaten back East (i.e. it's fantastic).\n\nFor first timers, you will probably get \"the itis\" after eating here: make sure you have someone else with you who can handle the insulin overload and can drive you home.

I had 20 people who RSVP'd to me that they would be coming so I called Lolo's Friday around 4:30 to make reservations because I know how busy that location gets on the weekend. I have made reservations at this location several times before and was told that there would be a $1.00 reservation per person but this time I was told that it would be $5.00 per person. I told the guy that took my reservation that it would not be a problem so he asked me for my credit card to make reservations for 20 people. I called back the next day (Saturday) at 1:50 because I had 7 more people that I had to add to our reservation and they said that would not be a problem they would just have to charge $5.00 per person to add them and I said that was fine because I knew even if we did not get that money refunded we would be spending at least that much. We had a great dinner and our waitress separated our bills like we asked when we had placed our orders. She came out gave everyone their bill and two people paid right away because they had to leave. When everyone else was ready to pay the waitress never came back so I had to go and find out what was going on. This is when I am finally being told that they had already charged my card for the entire party $541.00. I then told the Manager that we had asked for separate bills before we ordered. Then he says that I was charged $25.00 per person because I had made reservations. Well first if all if that was true the amount would not be $541.00 it would have been $500.00 for 20 people because they charged my card Friday the day before I even added the extra 7 people so that is a lie. Then I am being told that because I reserved the party room I was being charged some type of catering party package and they start showing me this contract that I have never seen before. I then tell Chris and the Manager that I did not ask to be put in a party room and if they chose to seat our large party there then that was their choice. I have made reservations there before for our company with large groups and it had never been an issue before. I then ask the waitress what the total bill was for our entire party and she says it was $440.00 so they are overcharging us $101.00! Then they tried to say it was because they charge $25.00 per person and I then told them if it would make sense for someone to make reservations for $25.00 per person when the most expensive item on the menu is $15.00, ridiculous! The manager then had to call the owner twice to explain the situation because they were not going to refund our money. After 40 minutes of him going back and forth on phone with the owner he finally got the approval to give us the refund. First I had to pay our tab which was over $200.00 and then because there were two families that had paid and left I had to pay their tabs too because they had issued a refund back to their cards because they actually thought that we were going to just pay the $541.00 like we were idiots! So I ended up paying $140.00 for those tabs as well. Then the manager goes to do our refund and he does not have the authorization to complete a refund for that amount, UNBELIEVABLE! So then we are told that we would get a call back on Sunday to get it taken care of and nobody calls us back so I have to end up calling them. I talked to Chris on the phone and he then tells me that the owners are on vacation and they will not be able to issue the refund until they come back to town. What kind of owners does not empower their managers to make decisions and issue refunds, but also what type of customer service is that! I ended up having over $800.00 taken out of our account just for dinner!! The account that was used belongs to our club team account that is a non-profit, so now our team is out $541.00 that is raised by the players with sponsorships and donations to use to pay for gym fees and tournaments and now we do not have those funds to use. That is not all, I then call another location and I am told that the owners are not on vacation and the only way to communicate with them is to go online and submit a request, even after we had given specific instructions to the managers Saturday night that we wanted a phone call from the owners. I sent this exact letter to the owners on their website like I was told and to this day I still have not received one response from anyone at Lolo's. I had to dispute the charges with my bank finally because our team needs the money to pay for our gym this week and a tournament. Don't ever trust Lolo's with your credit card because they will lie to you.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It's been on my AZ bucket list for 2 years. To say I was excited would be an understatement. I was dancing in anticipation. It wasn't very busy which seemed like a plus. We were seated immediately. Seemed like another plus. We waited about 50 minutes for our food- soul crushing. As we watched people who were seated long after us be served my rumbling tummy began to wonder where the F my food was. Our waitress didn't come back that entire time to check on us so I couldn't really update my stomach on the sitch. On a time restraint and irritated my adorable boyfriend (I have one now) flagged down an employee and ask them to check on our order as basically everyone else in the restaurant but us was eating. At this point our waitress finally surfaced for the first time in 45 minutes. We asked her how everyone who was seated after us was already eating and she told us TO ASK THE KITCHEN. Are you kidding me?! Also, they messed up my boyfriend's order and didn't give him all his food but we couldn't tell her because she vanishes like.. I don't know, anything that vanishes quickly and for long periods of time that doesn't want to return. We asked for the manager at this point and told him what the waitress said\/ about the wait\/ the food and he also blamed the kitchen. I feel really bad for the inanimate kitchen at this point. It gets blamed for everything. I don't think the kitchen is to blame when people who come in well after us get their food before us but I also haven't really worked in the industry so I might be wrong. Strong sense says she simply didn't put our food in and doesn't know how to take responsibility. The manager didn't apologize for the waitress' attitude or take anything off the bill for us waiting nearly an hour and messing up our order or for their service. He did offer a free dessert, however, it was 10 in the morning and we were already over their bologna. My suggestion- Take some ownership! This was our first time in your establishment. You guys messed up. You let us sit there for 50 minutes after we placed our order watching people who sat down after us eating without ever checking in on us. We had to flag you down. Your waitress told us to go in the back AND ASK THE KITCHEN WHAT WAS TAKING SO LONG. Listen, if I knew I could freely go in the kitchen I would have made a snack because I was hungry as all get out. \n\nThe  foodie in me and die hard downtownian is deeply disappointed and will likely never go back or recommend. \n\nI gave it two stars because the chicken and waffles were alright.. the restaurant was clean. I got a refill on my coffee in my cute ass Lolo's mug from someone who was not my rude waitress.. although since I'm here writing this I might as well say that the mug had a large chip on the rim some could say is a liability. The hot sauce was good. I am a big hot sauce girl. My water came with a lemon which could be construed as classy and didn't taste like gross AZ tap and one waitress had cute hair and smiled at me..so that was nice.","useful":6,"funny":8,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I had bookmarked this place even before we had left for TX, so I made it clear that when we head back after our trip...we would come here to eat.\n\nWe did that.\n\nIt was really easy to find. Pulling in I could see there were people waiting outside for their turn at some Lolos. We didn't get deterred because it didn't look that bad of a wait. Entering the restaurant...it was packing in there! It was a Sunday afternoon around 1 something, and it was filled! Anyway, we were told twas going to be a 45 minute wait. Initially, I thought crap...only because we had been driving since El Paso and there were hungry lions to be fed. THANKFULLY, we didn't have to wait for 45 minutes. Apparently, most the folks waiting ahead of us lost patience and left. Welp, yay for us. Hallelujuer. Think we waited for about 20minutes.\n\nWe get seated and was not immediately greeted by a waiter\/tress. But, I didn't mind because we were trying to tame these wild animals into their seats all while trying to stare at the menu (which btw we were already staring at the to-go menus they had available as we were waiting to be seated). I'd say 5 minutes later our waitress comes by and tells us she'll be right with us as she has dirty plates in tow. \n\nShe comes back, we order immediately. Hungry and on a time battle here. I ordered the toy-toy. 2 wings and a waffle. The boys ordered their chicken tenders that come with cornbread, and the husband orders 3pc chicken with waffles. \n\nDining out I am not one to order fried chicken. Mainly because I've tried chicken that isn't home cooked and they've all tasted nasty. Like, well cooked on the outside...still soggy from the batter on the inside, salty, peppery, lack of meat, oily, etc...so ordering the 2 wings was ideal for me because incase I did not like the chicken...it wouldn't be much chicken to eat, thus, wouldn't be much chicken to go to waste.\n\nNever fails, the 1 time I'm being cautious is the 1 time.im thinking, damnt! Their chicken was NOT dry. It was moist, seasoned properly, and just cooked almost perfectly. I say almost because I like my wings to be extra crispy. But for someone who doesn't order chicken dining out, it was close to perfect. The waffle was nice and soft with crisp edges. \n\nTried my boys tenders and those things were fat and moist as well! The cornbread, however, which comes with their plate was overcooked. You could tell it was just by looking at it. It looked like it was 5 minutes away from becoming burnt. I love cornbread. However, I didn't love cornbread on this day. \n\nAlso, the fries that came with my boys' plates...I felt were way too seasoned. I had to dust off the seasoning just so my toddler can enjoy it properly. It just became way too salty after each fry. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a chicken and waffle joint. Their chicken and waffle did not disappoint at all! They do have LOTS of other items on their menu if chicken and waffles aren't your fancy. I can see where people may feel they are pricey in some parts of their menu, but from my quick experience...it's worthed. I really wish we had more time so I could explore their other items, but we will save that for another trip. We had a nice experience, despite the children going wild. Lol. Will DEFINITELY return and will definitely put my stamp of recommendation.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I don't know that there is anything on the menu that is bad! My boyfriend and I wanted to go out to eat on a Saturday night. We were starved but couldn't decide. I usually pick the region of food and he picks the restaurant (bc he's from here and I'm not). I said hearty American food or American bistro. We decide as we're walking to the car....CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. So random. \n\nWe get to Lolo's and I'm loving the atmosphere. The art on the walls is cool. The music is good. Everyone looks happy to be stuffing their faces. I see mason jars with colorful drinks all over which really sparked my interest. BUT decided against booze and went with a traditional sweet tea. Holy cow was this sweet tea everything I hoped it would be. It reminded me of sweet tea in the south. Like Georgia south. The REAL south. Not too sugary but not super bitter. It was just right and so refreshing. \n\nWe got an app sampler platter. Fried okra, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, and slaw. The fried okra was crispy and seasoned to perfection. The potatoes were creamy. The mac n cheese was probably my favorite. You know when the cheese is sharp enough that it doesn't need seasoning and does that warm gooey thing when you pull it apart. Ya ...it was like that! The slaw wasn't soggy like most slaw is at bbq joints. It was still crispy and very flavorful. \n\nThen dinner came! We both opted for chicken and waffles. The chicken was so moist and the batter was fried for the perfect amount of time. Its like they have it down to a science in the kitchen here. The outside is crispy and seasoned well and the inside is moist and hot. The waffle was delicious. It almost had a sweet flavor too it. It wasn't chewy it wasn't soggy. It was as if the food was plated, put in the window, and whisked away to our tables immediately. Each bite I took I made sure to have an equal chicken to waffle ratio and dabbed it in syrup then in a little hot sauce. My mouth is watering just reminiscing about this meal lol.

Let me just say, I can't believe it took me 4 years to come here, no seriously, I have to slap myself silly for that because LoLo's has renewed my faith in fried chicken. Seriously, I think that was the best fried chicken I've had in my life. The chicken was fried to a perfection, nice golden crisp with minimal grease, that's right, MINIMAL grease! I didn't think that was physically possible for fried chicken but LoLo's debunked that myth! I have the #7, which was 3 chicken wings and a waffle. I've already swooned over the fried chicken, now the waffle was ok, nothing too special, same stuff you get at a waffle house. I still can't get over the friend chicken though.....Anyways, I really liked the atmosphere here, on the south end of downtown, this place gets crazy packed for lunch. A lot of regulars come here and it's obvious from the waiters and waitresses hootin and hollering at the customers when they come in by their first names, kind of cool!

I hadn't been here since they were just a back room to somebody's kitchen so seeing the expansion gave me high hopes because it presented itself nicely...the interior is the ONLY thing that presents itself well.\n\nWe walk in and the unenthusiastic hostess asked how many was in our party and I told her 8.  Being that the rest of the party live further, it would take them a while, so she informed us she can't seat half of our party until the full 8 showed up. Ugh yeah, right. I'm hungry and I'm not waiting so we just asked to be seated for our four. So after letting her know it would just be us for, she writes my name and instructs me to \"scoot\"  to the side and sit down. In slow motion, I turn around and all of the waiting benches are taken soooo where the hell am I suppose to sit, on the older ladies lap that was already sitting there?! She could have easily said \"it will just be a few moments, if you'd like you can take a seat that's available behind you\". Was that too difficult?! So I say whatever, they sat us within the next two minutes.\n\nOur waiter\/manager of the restaurant takes our drink orders and he seemed pretty cool cuz he was joking a lil with us.  So my cousin asks if she can put in an order for someone who was showing up a little later and then that's when things went down hill.  We were informed we couldn't do that because it would be cold by the time he came and blah blah blah.  Brotha, that's another order which results into money into your business' pocket.  So we order our food but he let's us order for our cousin who would show up late.  So we place the order and literally 5 minutes later, a different server comes out and says \"UM this is for someone showing up late or somethin\".  Ok, so you mean to tell me there was a discussion about this tiny little request in your kitchen amongst several servers.  Not to mention our order hadn't even come out yet, so the \"complicated\" order was first to come out when our orders were the smallest.  My friend asks why my cousins order came out so fast and why we haven't received ours, so that's when the title of this review comes in \"ma'am we cook chicken and waffles all day, some orders will be quicker than others\". Huh?! I know I didn't major in computer science but this really wasn't THAT complex.  So luckily my cousin walks in just in time to eat his food so it didn't get cold like Mr. Manager\/Waiter\/Host\/Fry Cook (he seriously wore many hats) mentioned. \n\nI don't wanna come to a place to eat when there's all these rules and instructions beginning with who and how many people can sit with me.  Being a California native, Roscoe's will always be THE Chicken & Waffles place that dominates any other competition.  Compared to Roscoe's, this place is amateur.  At least with Scoes they seat you no matter what time your party arrives, your food comes out within 5-10 minutes from the time you place your order, and you have a server who is just that...a server.  Not the building instructor, valet attendant or whatever our so called 'server' was to us.  This place will never get my business ever again.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We were the 5th group in line and by the time the doors opened there was a pretty good sized line. As soon as we sat down I got up to use the bathroom (morning coffee works fast!) and noticed that EVERY table was full. I mean every table (this is approximately 45 seconds after opening the doors). \n\nNow, I worked in the restaurant business for over 5 years and that would have been a NIGHTMARE at any of the places I worked at. I was intrigued to see how they would handle it. \n\nThey used a \"shotgun\" approach to serving, we saw at least half a dozen servers throughout our entire meal asking and getting us what we needed. The service was not notably friendly, but it was fast and efficient and there was almost always a server within earshot if we needed something. I have no complaints here, but I am relatively easy to please on the service side (probably the 5 years doing it myself ;)\nAnyway, on to the food, we all tried to order so that we could try all the \"famous\" items. So I ended up having some of each of the following: Chicken, Waffles, Grits, Cheese Eggs, and Fried Okra.\nI am going start at the best and move down. One caveat before we begin, I am not at all a fried chicken fan, I eat it on occasion but have never been excited about it or sought it out. \n\n1.) The Chicken: It was absofreakinlutely amazing. I am talking breathtakingly good. I'm talking take a bite and then hold it out in front of you to look at it to make sure it is just a piece of fried chicken in your hand. It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and not at all greasy. I don't know what they put in the batter but it was awesome. I am starting to salivate right now actually. I did try it true southern style with syrup on it, which was good, but I stopped because I felt the syrup was detracting from the overall flavor. I am not going to attempt to describe the taste, you are just going to have to go and try it for yourself; I will never do it justice. By FAR the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. All of this impression was with going in there with REALLY high expectations, if that tells you something.\n\n2.) The Waffles: Like I just mentioned, I went to Lo Lo's with really high expectations because of friends and Yelp reviews. I was not disappointed here either. They were very, very tasty, and even slightly exceeded my expectations. They are the best waffles I have ever had, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, smothered in butter and syrup YUM. I cleared my plate despite the physical pain of eating so much. I would go back here just for the waffles, but I have to admit, the margin by which the chicken exceeded my expectations was much larger.\n\n3.) The Grits: They were very good; I probably won't get them next time, not because they were lacking but because they would take up valuable chicken and waffle space in my stomach. My only previous experience with grits was in the Army, and obviously, this was an entirely different species of grits.\n\n4.) The Cheese Eggs: These were tasty, fluffy and cheesy, overall exceptional eggs. Mine got a little syrup and butter on them which actually were really good. I can't decide if I would forfeit more bits of chicken and waffles for them though =P\n\n5.) The Fried Okra: Also very good, and a great appetizer. We had a native Texan with us who is a rabid okra fan and she said they were the best fried okra she had ever had. For me though, they will likely go the way of the grits next time.\n\nFor drinks we all got tea, mine was the only unsweet one (which was really good). The sweet tea fans in the group said it was the best sweat tea they have had in Arizona.\n\nOverall we got our food fast, our drinks stayed full and the food was phenomenal and even better than were expecting (and we were expecting greatness). I will now be a regular customer and am going to start browbeating my friends that haven't tried it yet to go with me ;)\n\nLo Lo, I sincerely hope this restaurant has made you a wealthy man because it would be a crime if it hasn't.","useful":6,"funny":3,"cool":7,"type":"review"}

I'm from out of state and I've never been to Lolos I was excited to eat there as their menu has a lot of variety and delicious things.  Back to the stank attitudes, we had a large party their waiting area is small we were constantly harassed to move out of the entry which we were not blocking.

The approach and attitude these girls oozed was just plain Ghetto.  Their tone, body language and demeanor was just foul!  Their manager Antjuan (the one with the gold grill) also not helpful.

Don't go there unless you are ready to indulge.\n\nI would also strongly recommend NOT going there with large groups. I see there are 4 votes for \"Good for Groups\" for this place. That is insane.

Unfortunately, with limited food to choose from and slow service (despite the feeling we got that everyone working was just trying to go home and not be bothered) - tonight was the exception. \n\nWe had butts in the booth at 9:59 tonight, and as the waitress handed us menus we were told they only serve chicken and waffles after 10 pm. NO sides - no eggs - nothing but chicken and waffles. Couldn't even get a salad. Fine, except that the table immediately ahead of us was able to order whatever they wanted, and we were the only other table waiting to order. Seriously, guys? The cut-off is THAT strict? We could HEAR that family order. That's BS. Not to mention, since all we had to choose from was chicken and waffles, why waste our time by giving us menus? Y'all. Get it together. \n\nThen, 20 minutes AFTER we put our order in (which was at 10:05 btw), a server delivers mac-n-cheese to a different table. Tell me again why you can't send a side over to our table at the same time? Smh. \n\nSomewhere between being charged for a lemonade we didn't order and it taking forever for the waitress to come back for our checks, I lost a little faith in Lolo's. I usually eat a lot earlier and now that I know about it, the limited menu after 10 won't be an issue for me. I just won't come then. \n\nThe service tonight WAS an issue, along with the fact that their \"after 10\" policy seemed inconsistently enforced. Before tonight, I never hesitated to recommend Lolo's. Now, I have to add my own \"after 10\" disclaimer to match how awful theirs is.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Getting the gravy on the side is the best decision you'll ever make. Unlike Roscoe's, which pairs regular brown gravy, Lo-lo's pairs some sort of spiced and onioned concoction that reminds me of the drippings gravy you make on Turkey Day. I literally dipped my entire meal (waffles, grits, eggs) in this gravy and still couldn't get enough.\n\nMy only grip is that the Lo-lo's in Scottsdale takes amex, but this one doesn't. =(.\n\nBut seriously, Lo-lo's....could eat it every day. IN fact, we we're here for one week, and at Lo-lo's twice.\n\nOh yeah, the Red Velvet cake is RIDICULOUS.","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

You know - he sits on the couch, slouched with his hand down the front of his pants to give more room to his gut.  That's me right now, only with WAY better hair.\nHad the #10.  Because I'm a 10, get it?  Two chicken legs with a waffle.  I went with Julia T., Jason W., Nathan S., Amanda B., and David SB tonight.  We all ordered different sides so we could share.  Our end of the table shared the collard greens , mac and cheese and candied sweet potatoes.\nThe platter of chicken and waffles arrived.  You should see the scoop of butter on the waffle!  A scoop!  Not a pat!  The chicken legs were perfectly done - moist, not greasy, with an awesome coating that wasn't too much.  The waffle was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I'm glad it came with syrup, not maple syrup.  I detest maple anything.  I lived in New England too long.\nNathan leaned over and suggested we pretend we were making an Ice Cube movie, Babershop-style, and pick an actor to play each of us.  I was Angela Bassett, of course.  \nCollard green were yummy!  Not over-cooked, with hunks of the stems thrown in.  The sweet potatoes were pretty sweet, but not overly so.  Mac and cheese?  Yes, please! (that rhymed!)  And the tea.  Ohhhhhh the tea.  I got the half and half sweet.  I figured there was enough sugar in my meal that I didn't want to bounce off the walls and crash like a 4-year old after Halloween.  I had two huge glasses - actually, jars.  It's served in Kerr canning jars.  The big ones.  It was so good (How good was it???) that as I got up from my corner seat and walked around to leave, I reached over to take one last huge swig.  \nI'm full.  Not Thanksgiving-dinner full, but properly sated after a meal at LoLo's.  \nThe company rocked and I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant dinner crowd!  \n(p.s. We pegged Whoopie to play Julia.  Ha!)","useful":16,"funny":15,"cool":15,"type":"review"}

Boy was I wrong!!!\n\nThe food is amazing.  Fried chicken perfectly seasoned, juicy and crispy! Mac & chee, waffles, green beans all cooked to southern perfection! \n\nA giant mason jar of blue kool-aid is the ultimate accompaniment  in my opinion, but they now have a wide range of alcoholic bevvies to wet your whistle if you prefer.\n\nChef Nicky stopped by our table twice to personally ask us about how we enjoyed our food - nice touch!  (And this is just one example of the spectacular service that we experienced the entire time we were at LoLo's!)\n\nThis place is rockin! I can't wait to show it off to out of town guests and local friends alike!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Luckily we made it out of the Science Center in enough time to get lunch here before they closed for the day. We were quickly seated and taken care of. Our food came out quickly and we dove in. It was delish as usual and my friend said that LoLo's won that battle. \n\nThat said, if you want some good fried chicken and waffles, head here.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}
