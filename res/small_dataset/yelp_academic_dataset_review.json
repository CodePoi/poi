(Unless morbidly curious...)\n\nOur somewhat stunted little province is rife with these mysteriously expensive food chains that serve this flavorless & nutriionally-bereft quasi-food garbage. Service was helpful to my inquiries; I ordered a chicken burrito, and the toppings actually looked fresh made if the tortilla didn't (it was on the verge of cracking). Way too much in a hurry to assemble and not properly heat through, though there was little solid food in it to heat I guess. The smattering of chicken tasted re-heated and salty, the sauce toppings weren't bad but the fresh veggies & particularly the onions tasted stale, stale, stale. The 'cheese' was barely present in flavor and may as well have been (or was it actually?) colorful wax shavings sprinkled on the somewhat miserly contents that altogether did not really satisfy.\n\nI did get through said pathetic 7-dollar burrito, and though that was a rip off there was at least a sale this week (um, the deal gets worse?). But if this is what 'gourmet' fast food has become, I'm opting out. What a ripoff. Seems like the place was designed by yield managers whose sole and soul-less aim was to empty your wallet cynically & efficiently allowing the least imaginable enjoyment or health benefit possible.\n\nQ: Is it THAT hard to make decent cheap TexMex takeout east of the DVP? Burrito Boys on Peter Street kicks this place in the keister. People are not stupid, you know and the Beach has its share of doubters when it comes to eating out down the block. What a stupid, cynical farce of a resto chain this is, there's no way Z-teca will last here or ever make money. Certainly what they do take in money-wise doesn't show in quality.\n\nHere's a sharp business idea: when it comes to food you have to give an actual shit and not serve virtual shit.

I had previously had a drink or two here in the past but had not ever sat down and eaten dinner. \n\nService was underwhelming. It took our waitress some time to greet us initially and to take our order. At one point, we were ready to order our entrees, but she left our table so quickly that we didn't have time to tell her that we were ready. Also, for being a restaurant with a number of alcoholic beverages, our waitress knew very little about what Rivertowne offers. Though a nice girl, I think Rivertowne could invest more time and training in their employees.\n\nI started with a beer and almost made a face when my beverage was brought to me in a tiny plastic cup. I get that Rivertowne is heavily trafficked from Heinz Field, PNC Park, and Stage AE attendees but that doesn't mean you should be able to both serve beer in a throwaway cup and charge full price.\n\nFinally, the food... meh. I ordered fried fish with potato wedge fries. The fish was OK, but the flavorless wedges required ketchup to be consumed. Plus, I was a little turned off by the dish initially when the man delivering the food stated, \"Here is your catfish.\" My catfish?! I definitely didn't order catfish. I questioned him about it, and he just seemed confused.\n\nIn the future, I would prefer to walk a couple miles to downtown and pay less money for more and better food.

She stopped by while my wife was away from our table, and when I asked her if she would be able to return in a few minutes, it was no problem. And when she did, she was attentive, listening to my wife's account of the night of our previous visit. She was the perfect server for us that night - and hopefully, we have her again in the future. \n\nAs for our order - well, as I said earlier, we were simply there for dessert and hot beverages, which hit the spot perfectly. My wife, who is a big-time coffee drinker, really enjoyed her Irish coffee and I enjoyed my hot chocolate. As for the dessert - she was also very happy with that. \n\nTo sum it up, everything that went right at the Rivertowne the second night redeemed all that didn't go right the first time. We're already anticipating our third time being just as good","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

My dad and I came here before going to the Steelers game, and the atmosphere was just excting.  I wanna come here just to watch a game.  While sitting in the stadium I kept thinking back to Rivertowne thinking, \"wow i bet everyone in there is enjoying the game and having a blast together.\"  If you cannot get tickets to go to the game, go here and grab some good food and make some new friends.  With that being said, lets move on to the goodies.\n\nThe appetizer we got were the Wileys Mushrooms.  I scoped out the menu before coming here, and I knew I was going to order these before I even walked into the front door.  They were excellent.  Cheesy goodness, mixed with some peppers, and of course the delicious mushroom.  Not to mention it was served on a sizzling plate.  It was completely gone within a minute.  \n\nMy dad and I split some garlic parmesean wings.  Now I gotta say, I have become a garlic parm connoisseur over the past couple years.  I have to admit these bad boys ranked real high on my top list.  They were not flooded in garlic sauce (this could be a turn off for some people depending on the mood you are in), but I was satisfied with the \"garlicness.\"  \n\nMoving onto the main course.  I got the Baja stuffed fish.  This thing was some kind of white fish that was jam packed with crab meat.  It was amazing.  From now on, if i am in the mood for fish, I am going here.  I have no clue what kind of \"white fish\" it was, and I don't care.  It was that good; i promise you.  A little side note was that the veggies that came with it were great too.  I wish I would've gotten the double order that I asked for, but it was no big deal; the place was packed, so you have to expect little mess ups from time to time.\n\nMy dad got this burger that had a piece of kielbasi on it.  He loved it.  Right when we left he was already talking about trying to recreate it once we got home.   I did try a bite, and I have to admit it was good.\n\nLike I said this is not only a great place for food, but also a great place to watch the game or just hang out.  Luckily I have one of these right near my house.  You can bet ill be visiting another Rivertowne before this month is over.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

She ordered a lettuce chicken wrap, I opted for fish and chips, substituting cole slaw for the fries.  She said her wrap was quite unimpressive, and my fish - although a nice size serving, was just lousy. Soggy throughout as if it had been soaking in water.

Cole slaw was not bad, but a very small portion.\n\nBeer menu was extensive but overly weighted to high alcohol content beers. \n\nService was fine, ambiance was loud, menus were sticky and stained (man, I hate that).\n\nThis was our second visit and I think next time we'll try someplace else on the North Shore.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I don't need a triple hopped, double oaken Hefeweizen. They have a nice selection across various different styles too.  They also carry some select beers that are not Rivertowne beers.  \n\nI have never had food here, so I cannot comment on that, but in perusing the menu it looks like your standard bar fare.  \n\nOn nights where there is no game or even is when I find it to be the best.

The hockey game was on and an excited buzz generated through the room. The doors opened at Stage AE around 7pm but I knew Snoop would not get on stage until later so we had time to chat and have some drinks. The selection on tap was decent and the menu was plentiful. \n\nWe struck up a conversation with the guys who let us sit and they got me even more excited explaining that Snoop does not disappoint but that he would most definitely show up pretty late. This info gave us more time to relax, and snack on a deep fried pretzel with our Guinness pints. Then they started playing some old Snoop Dogg hits to cement the jovial mood of the crowd. All the appetizers coming out of the kitchen looked tasty.\n\nThe only incident we had was that our buddies being a little inebriated spilled some vodka soda over my head.

For this review, service gets a D and food gets an A+\n\nWe walked in and the hostess was incredibly rude. She mumbled something (in a loud bar area during a Pirates game, it's difficult to hear) about table or bar and when my husband asked what she said, she mumbled the same thing and I said we'd like a table. She turned around and started walking away. So we stood there until she turned back around and looked at us with a face that says \"Why are you not following me?\" So we followed her to our table where she threw our menus down and started to walk away. I said thank you and she didn't even look at me. When we sat down, I noticed some water left on the table and was wondering if I should go to the bar to get a towel. The hostess came back and wiped it down without me asking and when I said thank you again, she just walked away. If you have ever been to a Dick's Last Resort restaurant where they make the paper hats and are total jerks to the customers as part of the ambiance, this hostess should quit and move to one of those restaurants immediately. She would do much better in a restaurant like that.\n\nNext, our waitress came to our table and took our drink order. She brought them back to us and was pleasant enough but definitely not as enjoyable as the lady who brought our food who had a smile on her face the entire time she was at our table. I wish she could rub off on the hostess...\n\nNow for the food: AMAZING. We decided to share two entrees so that we could try different items. We split the seafood mac and cheese and a small coconut shrimp bucket. The seafood mac and cheese was creamy and delicious and full of shrimp and scallops. The scallops were tender and paired perfectly with the red peppers that are in the dish as well. The coconut shrimp bucket was absolutely incredible. A small bucket (you have the option of small or large) comes with five HUGE shrimp battered with coconut flakes and served with a large amount of french fries. The sweet chili sauce that the dish comes with is the perfect amount of spicy to pair with the sweetness of the coconut. \n\nWe also enjoyed different beers, all brewed by Rivertowne, that were very good. I had \"Always a Home Game\" and \"Grateful White\", the hubby had \"Babbling Blonde\" and \"Hala Kahiki\". Very good beer.\n\nSo, overall, the service experience is definitely lacking (mostly because of the hostess working that night) but the food is incredible and will make up for any bad experience with service. I will be back again and again on nights I don't have anywhere to be when I can just sit outside with my beer and my food, enjoying the beautiful sites of Pittsburgh from the river's edge.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I really want to give this place 5 stars but there are definitely some areas that need improvement.  \n\nWhat doesn't need improvement - at least in my opinion - is the food and drink.  The food is bar food but it is well-priced and there is a good amount of diversity on the menu.  I typically order the baked italian sub, the buffalo chicken wrap, and the turkey bacon wedgie (that's right wedgie). The Pizzas also look great but I have never had one.  The draft list is always diverse and I have tried some great new brews here.  This is a great place to watch any type of sporting event and they have a pretty decent happy hour as well - although sometimes you have to remind the servers what the specials are.  \n\nThis brings me to what prevents me from giving this place 5 stars - the service and the atmosphere.  First the service - I have had great experiences with the service and also experiences that are sub-par.  First - the waitresses are usually very nice but they neglect to write things down and food will come out incorrectly.  I am not one to send things back but this has happened more than once.  Also they are always willing to split up checks - which is very much appreciated but they seldom split them up correctly (because they don't write anything down).  The ladies at the host stand are sometimes miserable but almost always don't know what you are talking about when you let them know that you already checked-in with NoWait.  Finally, Rivertowne brings in the most annoying DJ  that plays awful music on Pirates Game Days.  This is completely not necessary - especially since there is a digital jukebox here.  Rather then be something that its not with the DJ - I just wish Rivertowne would play on its strengths and be a cool and funky sports bar with good food and drinks.\n\nDespite its shortcomings - unless something better opens up in the Northside I will likely keep coming back.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I know from my Pennsylvania Dutch background that pork and apples go well together.\n\nAnyway, this seemed more like a college bar to me than a brewpub.

Most recently I had the salmon blt  and was really surprised at how good it tasted. The sandwiches do not come with sides however the portion of the sandwich was large enough no sides were necessary. Served on Italian with lettuce, tomato, and a dill mayo (which I ordered on the side) the portion of salmon was larger than other salmon sandwiches I've had elsewhere and it was cooked perfectly - not dry at all. Of course bacon makes nearly everything better and I was happy it was crisp how I like it. The dill mayo gave a nice sauce for the salmon. Service was very attentive although we were the servers only table so no surprise there. My companion enjoyed the California burger ( no onions) with a spicy sriacha sauce which he said was very good. I'd also recommend any of the pizzas (Mon River Extreme is my favorite) as they have always been good. If you enjoy beer I'd also recommend trying the hala kahiki Rivertowne branded pineapple beer and Old Wylie's IPA is also a good one. They have a lot of other craft beers on tap too if none of the Rivertowne branded beers are appealing.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Here's a tip... take the ttc next time.\n\nThe store has very high ceilings and it's very spacious, even though it's not very big. There is not a lot of stock for each clothing piece nor is there a lot of different styles. Stussy has a lot of styles, but this store probably carries 50% of what they sell, which is disappointing because this is the only stussy store I know of in toronto. The worker also was pretty confused when I asked for sizes, and she answered 'I don't know\/I don't think so...' with a pretty uncertain voice. She just didn't seem knowledgable..\n\nStussy clothing is pretty good quality, but honestly I could take any plain top, stamp the logo on it and sell it for $40. In my opinion, the brand is not worth the price, so don't bother. But since we walked so far, I coerced my friend into buying a shirt to make our trip not seem so wasted.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I've tried maybe 6 or so of their dishes, and have yet to be disappointed. \n\nI haven't had a bad experience yet at this place. The service is always nice.

(Scroll down for my thoughts on the place in general) I initially was only going to store a few belongings there, but ended storing my car there as well (more about that in a second). I received a phone call from Tricia shortly after booking the unit through the third party site. She was\/is one of the sweetest people I've ever talked to. She was thorough in explaining everything from pricing to answering any questions I had as well as being personable, which can be hard through a phone conversation. Little did she know her upbeat attitude and ginuineness relieved the stress I was having about storing my things. Not only that; but made me feel better as I was going through a rough time which is why I had to store my things in the first place. Thank you Tricia! Now to Mr. Tj! All i can say is he is beyond AWESOME! As I said before I wasn't going to store my car, but circumstances changed and because Tricia was so great I decided to check to see if they stored vehicles as well. I went back the following day and Tj was there and he even remembered me from the day prior. He got me all set up, explained everything in detail, cracked some jokes and even gave me a few places to look at in my apt search. Not only that, but after we said our goodbyes I had to go back to my car, grab a few things then wait for an uber to take me to the airport. Tj offered to drive me back to my car, but I opted to walk instead. By the time I got all of my things out of the car and looked up Tj and the golf cart were there to help me as well as drive me back to the front where the uber driver was waiting! This was probably the best and one of the most memorable customer service experiences I've had! If you're looking for a safe, (double gated and video camera monitored as well as climate controlled) immaculately clean place to store your things with no worries; and beyond awesome people you can trust this is your place!

As on the previous visit, we ordered rice for one, salad for the other, intending to share both.  The waitress offered to have the kitchen divide it for us, and when the plates came out, it was if we weren't sharing at all - we each had so much rice (perfectly cooked) and salad (fresh and full of a variety of stuff), together with a substantial portion of the lamb, that we each took home enough for a second full meal.\n\nThe other friend is Israeli, and this is her comfort food.  She had a hankering for Liver and Onions.  If she hadn't been with us, it would have been another 5-star rating.  But her liver was way overcooked, and she didn't like it.  She did, however, love the hummus, which we ordered as a single side dish but had it as an appetizer.  It was a huge portion for $4.50.

For some reason or another, I've had Nan & Byron's on my list of \"must-try restaurants\" for a while and with them participating in Charlotte Restaurant week this Summer, I decided this would be a good opportunity.  My friend made reservations for early Saturday evening (7-18-15) and we had no trouble getting parking spots in their limited parking lot. \n\nThe exterior really feels reminiscent of a small firehouse (which I believe the space was before it was turned into a restaurant) and has a very intimate and modern feel on the inside. Our waitress greeted us and let us know about our meal options. We both ordered from the restaurant week menu (which included an alcoholic beverage of your choice) and munched on the complimentary popcorn basket. I really liked the popcorn, it has a subtle spicy kick to it.  I ordered a glass of Malbec and started off with the crispy oysters. The oysters are each served with slices of jalapeno and pineapple. A nice balance of heat and sweet. Unfortunately, the oysters are quite bland on their own and I didn't find them to be that crispy. My friend ordered the sweet chili wings and I much preferred those over the oysters.\n\nFor the main entrée, I went with the wagyu flank steak. It was served with \"crushed\" aka mashed potatoes and broccolini. I was HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED in the steak. I asked for it medium and it was inconsistently warm throughout. Lukewarm steak is just a no-no. The potatoes were the warmest thing on the plate and they had nice flavor thanks to the scallions that were mixed in. The broccolini was just....there. I had a few pieces of it but I much prefer regular ol' broccoli.  My friend ordered the filet mignon and she was also disappointed in her meal.\n\nFor dessert, I went with the key lime tart. Of course the one thing I don't take a picture of ends up being the best part of the meal. This was a winner. I looked at their menu and it doesn't appear to be a regular offering of theirs. They should change that right now. It's the perfect summer dessert. The tart was served with blackberry sauce and the balance of the acidic lime and sweet blackberry worked so well together. Not too heavy and nice light flavors. I could've probably eaten an entire dish of that.\n\nThe service was great and very considerate but I was so disappointed in the overall meal, especially since I had been looking forward to eating there for quite some time. I'm going to blame the business of restaurant week for the meal quality and I hope to return to different experience trying out their brunch\/lunch menu.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I got the salmon dish which was one of their well known dish but the salmon was bland as well. It was grilled with nice grilled marks but it was a little fishy. I did however enjoy the sautéed kale and potatoes that accompanied it. \n\n The server was nice and patient in taking our orders for a party of 8 without fail as to forget anything we needed and was prompt in getting what we needed. We were there on a Thursday night and it was not crowded. \n\nAt last, for dessert I got the strawberry shortcake. That was pretty good with fresh made sponge cake, strawberries and a light cream in between the layers. \n\nIf I went back to nan and Byron's, it would be to get drinks and appetizers.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I have a lot to be thankful for. This place and the experience I had was definitely not one of them. To save you some time, my honest opinion is that I woulde NOT pick Nan & Byron's for anything again.\n\nMy wife and I decided to see my family in Dallas during Christmas break so we stayed in Charlotte and I chose Nan & Byron's for lunch after the Novant Health Thanksgiving parade because Capital Grille was all booked and I go to 5Church too often. The fact that the same management runs 5Church made me feel confident about my decision.\n\nThey weren't ready when we walked in. We walk in, tell the guy who greeted us that we had a reservation and he goes, \"you don't have a reservation?\" in the way that sounded like 'why are you here so early.' I did have a reservation by the way. He just didn't hear me right the first time.\n\nHe shows us the table and while we walk towards it, there's the entire restaurant employees sitting in a circle chatting although their business hours clearly started. By this time, I'm pretty much thinking this is going to be a disaster so let's try my best to have fun.\n\nSo, we wait for the apps, and we got happy because the biscuits and the salads were good. The turkey and the pork were not good, on the other hand. I tried to be a good sport though. And that was my Thanksgiving lunch at Nan & Byron's, where I didn't find a reason to go back to.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Few patrons, waited over an hour for food while surrounding tables were served. Food was cold. We all tried each other's dishes. The mushroom soup was viscous and dirty tasting. I've never had a mushroom soup that I couldn't eat. It was like drinking gravy. Waitress didnt ask why it was untouched. The meatloaf was bland and looked old. Vegetables were frozen peas and carrots out of the bag, seriously...they couldn't cut up their own carrots. Mashed potatoes were gummy. My boss didn't finish her scallops but didn't say anything. Ordered a side of grits, there was no salt in them and they were gummy instead of creamy.\n\nThe staff seemed fine. I think the problem is in the kitchen. They don't know how to manage the orders and the food isn't fresh or seasoned appropriately. I hope they fix this, but I'll never know.

The food was tasty, for the most part, & our server was friendly, but there was some confusion about what sides we ordered and some of the food we received wasn't even warm by the time it got to our table. Fortunately, management stepped up & took care of things.. well, mostly.\n\nAs soon as we were seated, we were given a bowl of the addictive, seasoned popcorn. I'm a mindless snacker & we ended up going through 2 bowls throughout our meal.. plus we took a fresh batch home :) I ordered Dancing Cranberries, which consisted of prosecco, white cranberry juice, and dried cranberries. It was very good & what an apropos name for this drink! The little cranberries were bouncing around due to the carbonation of the prosecco.. pretty amusing.. or maybe I'm just easily amused?\n\nWe got the peppadew popper app & it was quite good as well, though nothing amazing. I think I would have preferred a different type of pepper, with a little more spice & less sweetness, but that's just me. I mean, it was still tasty.. you really can't go wrong with fried, cheese-stuffed peppers!\n\nFor my entree, I went with the mushroom & for my 2 sides I went potato on potato & got the mojito fries & mashed potatoes. BF ordered the meatloaf with slaw & corn as his sides. Our entrees arrived in a timely manner, but this is also where the confusion started. My mushroom had its quinoa stuffing but there was also some corn under it & I got my mojito fries. BF got his meatloaf, also with corn under it.. & sweet potato fries? We were each given a side we didn't order but our server said we could still keep them & brought out our other sides shortly after. Problem #1 solved.. or so I thought.\n\nThe second problem was that our food wasn't even warm. In fact, my mashed potatoes were straight up COLD. Not acceptable. My mushroom was room temperature & BF's meatloaf was barely warm, but he was still ok with it. I let our server know that my entree wasn't even warm, let alone hot, & told her it wasn't that big of a deal & if she could just stick it in the microwave to heat it up, I'd be fine, but she was extremely gracious about it & said they could cook a brand new one for me. I appreciated that but I don't like sending food back because it makes me feel high maintenance. I let her take the mushroom & kept quiet about my mashed potatoes & just took them home (they turned out to be very good after I heated them up).\n\nMy food was actually better than I expected, when it finally arrived, hot. I did notice that mushroom #2 was significantly smaller than mushroom #1 but whatever, at least I finally had an edible entree. The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the quinoa stuffing, but the portobello itself was deliciously marinated & nicely grilled. The mojito fries were also tasty. Normally, I'm pretty apprehensive about mint being in savory foods (the same way I feel about fruit inside salads.. *shudder*) but the flavors worked very well & I loved the little bit of tartness. I think BF liked the meatloaf & he said the sriracha ketchup was subtly spicy (which to him is a good thing).\n\nAfter we were done eating, our bill arrived & our server let us know they comped the mushroom for all of the trouble, which was pleasantly unexpected. However, we also noticed that we were charged for the slaw, when we shouldn't have been. I know, it's only $4, but the slaw was supposed to come with my BF's meal.. whatever. I just let it go because they DID take the mushroom off the bill & I felt like I was being super high maintenance all night. Still, it was a bit of a wtf moment.\n\nDespite all of the trouble, I can definitely see the potential in this place. They really do care about their customer's experience. We will be back & hopefully I will think this place is more than A-OK :)","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

It has a very different vibe than 5 Church- a more casual, yet still hopping atmosphere with rustic interior touches. I've been here for cocktails, dinner and three times for lunch. It's totally appropriate for SouthEnd.\n\nI highly endorse it for a place to meet friends for cocktails. Their cocktail\/bar menu is inventive and delicious. The bartenders are pretty speedy and friendly. \n\nAs Chad mentioned, the popcorn they give you is a nice way to give your mouth something to crunch on that I believe is nonfat (it's not oily, salty or buttery). It's a good thing because food comes out really really slowly and often not coordinated. In my experience if you have a table of 2, the meals come out at the same time. But if you have more than 2, it's your guess at what order\/timing everything will come out. I don't mind that at a tapas place where you're sharing plates with friends, but in a business context where you have  a sandwich and someone else has another sandwich or salad and you're not sharing, it's polite to wait until everyone has their meal.  The other complaint I have about the timing is that the three times I've been for lunch have extended to a 2-hour lunch unnecessarily. Apparently you should announce a the beginning of the meal to your server that you need to get back to work. After about an hour and a half, the last time my coworkers and I had lunch, we asked for the check (even though we weren't done) because we had to get back to work and the server seemed genuinely surprised. Huh? It's a weekday, why wouldn't we have to go back to work??? It was bizarre. Anyway my point is, it's totally fine for a catch up lunch with a friend on a weekend, but beware of a long lunch if you're a working stiff. \n\nTo the food... the peppadew poppers are really interesting and if you're willing to throw caution of calories to the wind, I highly endorse them.  The meatloaf is very grilled - I like the taste of it but the hubs did not. I appreciated the sriracha ketchup.  I do not really like the chicken- it runs very dry and the green beans I've had twice and both times they were over cooked.  If I were to go back for dinner I'd like to try the mushroom with quinoa or Tofu since their vegetarian entrees seem to be more interesting than their carnivorous ones.   For lunch, I definitely like the beet burger with boursin - it's my favorite thing on the menu. They brag about the farmhouse burger but there was something about it I didn't like. It was either the BBQ sauce or the poblano cheese, but the consistency and taste wasn't so good. Based on the wait my burger was \"dying in the window\" for a while and the cheese coagulated leaving a grainy, weird consistency. So my tip is definitely get the beet burger- you can't get that anywhere else, build your own burger. My friends really like the South End chicken hoagie too.  Though one time two of them got it and they came out at 2 different times and had different things on it. \n\nFor dessert, the shortcake is very heavy. We were able to take 2 bites of it and the rest went uneaten. The PB&J was very interesting and different so my favorite of the two. Next time I'd try the brownie sundae with chili sauce. \n\nBottom line- 2.5 stars - this is a place for cocktails or a place to go if you need something greasy, but just make sure you're not in a hurry or expect fantastic service.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

In this review, we'll focus on the large party experience. \n\nThis past friday night I was put in charge of organizing the dinner plans for a friend's 30th birthday dinner. My biggest pain point was the large party reservation process. First, when my reservation increased to over 10 people, I had to get in touch with the catering sales manager. The hosts on the phone would not take my reservation as they explained to me \"they weren't allowed to\". No problem. I can talk to someone else, but then I was expected to get in touch with that person, not the other way around, well it kinda ticked me off. Insert first pain point of customer service irritation. The next day that I called to change the reservation, I was instructed that once again \"I\" needed to get in touch with sales, and then I was informed that I would have to sign agreement, put a credit card on file and pay a $10 cover for any no shows. I get it - no shows and changes in reservations flat out suck, they do. However, when the most expensive entree on the menu is less than $20, I find this process a bit tough to swallow. Exhibit B of pain point. \n\nNow, after getting in touch with catering sales manager, I will say that she was very timely, professional and accommodating with the process. Not sure if this was on done on her behalf, but in lue of having to split up our tables inside the restaurant, we took the chances of sitting outside. Since we were gambling all our dinner plans around weather circumstances, the large party booking process was dismissed. Guess what... it turned out to be a glorious Charlotte evening. One that would have been perfect for sitting in the sweet Carolina air. Guess where my party sat... inside. After all the muss and fuss of not being able to find a table inside, that's exactly where we ended up. Strike 3! \n\nMoving on to the actual dining experience, our server was a doll. He took good care of us, kept the drinks flowing and timing was good except at the very end, when it took a solid 30+ minutes for checks and all. Food was average, drinks were yummy and decor was fab as always, but I certainly walked away feeling like I had just taken a big ol' swig of bitters from behind the bar. \n\nAll and all, I might swing by for a lunch if that's where a friend wanted to eat, but it probably won't be on my list of recommendations anytime soon.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The presentation was nice and they came out very quickly.  \nFor my entree I had the meatloaf sandwich with a side of mac and cheese.  The meatloaf sandwich was awesome with the spicy ketchup.

I think there are as many mac and cheese recipes in the south as there are stars in the sky.  We all have a preference for a different type.  I personally prefer the big ziti-type noodle in bechamel type sauce with baked-on cheese on top...almost like a macaroni casserole.  This was almost the opposite.  The noodles were big spirals and were awesome, but the cheese was smooth like velveeta.

After I saw this person go to an empty table I realized he worked there. On my way to the restroom I stopped an employee and asked who it was. I was told it was the owner. I was shocked and even more shocked when I walked out of the bathroom and saw him leaning up against an empty bar table( at the front of the restaurant), checking his phone and eating what appeared to be a banana... I never once saw him check on a table. He could have but I never witnessed it in my 2 hours of being there. He certainly never asked us how we were doing. It's hard for me to want to return after seeing the way he treated his employees. This was enough for me to download yelp for the first time and give a review...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The fella and I went on a Tuesday night and thought with the day (random Tuesday before Thanksgiving), time (8:00 pm) and weather (ungodly rain), it might be a little less crowded.  We were wrong.  Since I really did want to like this place, I'm going to start with the bad stuff so I can end on a good note.\n\nTHE BAD\n\nParking: The parking is still as annoying as it was with Vinnie's.  There's a valet, but he just directed me to a space coming available in the lot.  The fella wound up two blocks away in a random lot.\n\nHostess: We checked in at 7:55 for our 8:00 reservations.  The hostess acknowledged us, and then ignored us to answer the phone, which is one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves - always deal with paying customers first before answering the phone.  So, we checked in with the host.  Then the hostess seated two other groups.  We went back to the host, who apologized for the hostess and finally seated us.\n\nSeating: If there are two of you, you'll get stuck a two-top table in the middle of everything and everyone.  The fella got bumped into countless times by waiters and patrons alike.  It's a flurry of activity, and it's cramped quarters.\n\nWine Glasses: So, the wine glasses look exactly like the water glasses but just a tiny smidgen smaller.  The fella wasn't impressed with the lack of wine glasses or the fact that the wine came in a glass that wasn't bowl-shaped.  He was even less impressed when the waiter accidentally refilled his wine glass with water.  Considering there was about one-fourth of the wine left, I was the least impressed (as the bill payer) when there was no comp on the wine... seriously?!?!  \n\nTHE GOOD\n\nFood: Believe the hype about the peppedew popper appetizer ($5.50).  They're sweet and cheesy and delicious.  The meatloaf ($14.50) with sriracha ketchup was a great spicy twist on an old favorite.  (However, the mac & cheese and baked beans sides were just okay, and I didn't love that everything was stacked since my baked bean sauce kept getting mixed in with my meatloaf ketchup.)  The fella got the chicken ($14), which was a little dry but had a nice kick, and the slaw and mashed potato sides were excellent.\n\nOVERALL\n\nThe fella has already said he'll never go again.  I'd try it once more just hoping that tonight was an off night, but... ugh.  At least get some real wine glasses!  Talk about squashed excitement.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

The entire night our server was on point. She was friendly, but not too much, quick and helpful when it came to offering up dinner suggestions. The manager even came over to check on our meal. We made reservations and ate early, around 6:30. I would recommend this, considering this place tends to get busy. I really like the decor of N&B's- cozy with a twist. \nNow on to the food... \nWe all ordered the red wine blend that was on special, perfect way to start off the night, follow by their complementary popcorn... spicy and a little odd, but not bad, just not expected. We ordered the poblano cheese dip. Wow, It's heavy like you would expect and served with homemade chips, the only problem, you may completely ruin your appetite with this appetizer. \n\nOn to the main dishes- Between the meatloaf, tacos and my pork chops, everything was great. Heavy southern dishes all with a modern add on spicy grits and salmon tacos. The only downside, the majority of the menu was very heavy. I didn't think they had a lot of lighter options to choose from. The menu is a little on the pricier side- ranging from 18-30 dollars for an entrée, but I do think the pricing is justified. \n\nThe night was sealed with a sweet treat of turtle Cheesecake, on the house....

She also didn't know how to add an egg to a breakfast (someone wanted three eggs, only two arrived on the plate), and when someone wanted their eggs \"well done\" (half jokingly), she never clarified and just rang them in as over easy.

Everyday I drive past it and have wanted to go in. This weekend I finally got the chance. We showed up about 45 minutes early for our reservation so we just hung out at the bar and got some drinks. When we got seated we were put in the outdoor area that had a tent over it and some heat lamps. It was very crowded in the restaurant since it was the Saturday of Valentine's Day weekend, but it was freezing in the tent. We asked if we could move tables once we sat down because we all had to sit there in our winter coats to be even remotely warm. They moved us to a table that was still in the tent but closer to a heat lamp. While it was a bit warmer i definitely would have preferred to be inside since it was only 30 degrees out. That is where my complaints stop for Nan and Byron's though. \nWe started our meal with the Sushi Grade Tuna Tartare to split between the three of us and it was fantastic. I don't like Tuna Tartare when it is ground up but this was cubed tuna and was very buttery and delicious. It was a perfect palate cleanser to start the meal. I had heard wonderful things about their popcorn so we asked our waitress for some because it didn't look like they were giving it to everyone. It completely lived up to the hype. I would have never thought to put Cayenne on popcorn but now i can't see eating it without it. I ordered the Spiced Prime Bistro (medium rare), my dad got the C.A.B. Filet Mignon (medium rare), and my mom got the Pan Roasted Chicken Pot Pie. While ordering my dad also asked for a small Caesar salad but it never came. By the time we realized it never came we were already halfway through the meal and didn't think it was worth the trouble. My Spiced Prime Bistro was great. My only complaint about it was that it was a bit more medium than medium rare. The potatoes were to die for though. I could have made those my entire meal. My dad's C.A.B. Filet was also great and so was the Pan Roasted Chicken Pot Pie. The puff pastry was an awesome substitute to the normal pie crust for chicken pot pie. Like I said this is a great restaurant and I can't wait to go back!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It's a hip restaurant that has made a name for itself in the Charlotte dining scene. Unfortunately it has been a let down the two times I've gone. The first time was for dinner and the experience was \"okay\". I ordered one of their chicken dishes and some other fusion appetizer. There was a long wait to receive our meals and when it arrived the dishes were just merely acceptable--if anything, rather boring. \n\nThis second time I wanted to give the restaurant another try. I was hopeful that it would be as good as what everyone has hyped it up to be. Unfortunately the results of my visit were much worse than the first. From their dinner menu I ordered their Tuna Tartar (raw) and their Braised Lamb (medium rare). These are two risky but common dishes, and if done well, are usually quite wonderful. Unfortunately one (or both) of these dishes gave me food poisoning later on. Nothing severe, but unpleasant to say the least. Not sure what went wrong there, but I can say the lamb was a rubbery mess that was hardly edible and something I really should've sent back to the kitchen.\n\nThe service also did not improve the second time around. The wait was even longer for something less than satisfactory. The only redeeming factor of my visit was the Banana Pudding for dessert which was surprisingly good.

My first visit was centered around the bar as the plan was to check out the atmosphere of what appeared to be the new hot spot restaurant in South End. Having just recently moved from Uptown to a South End I was anxious to see what the fellas from 5 Church had going on. \n\nSnagging a spot at the corner of the bar offered a great view of a pretty busy restaurant for a weekday. The bar tenders were attentive and friendly even considering a full bar. After 30 minutes or so I I had to take a peak at the menu and decided that contrary to my initial plan of \"drinks only\" I was going to grab something small. Now, when a restaurant aims for what it appears Nan and Byron's is aiming for I like to give a good test of the menu and order something a bit atypical. That said, by offering a hot dog and mac and cheese a place like this I couldn't pass this opportunity up. It wasn't even on the kid's menu! Let's be honest, if you can nail a hot dog and mac and cheese at what appears to be a quality restaurant than more power to ya. Certainly I agree that with this order I couldn't have possibly expected much, but again, it is Nan and Byron's that offered it and so I had to take them up on it. \n\nUnfortunately I was pretty disappointed. I can't complain much about the value as these were some of the less expensive items on the menu but I can certainly complain of the quality. Honestly, if you are going to go out on a limb by offering a hot dog at a place like this then I'd expect you would at least reward the customer daring enough to order it. The presentation itself was good but the flavor wasn't much greater than what you'd expect from your most basic hot dog. When I asked the bar tender what we were dealing with she admitted she thinks it is a Nathan's hot dog...boiled! Not grilled, but boiled. Who in their right mind boils a Nathan's frank! As for the mac and cheese I can't really speak much about it; not much to write home about and although creamy couldn't help but think \"Velveeta\". I'm sure it wasn't and maybe I'm more of a baked mac and cheese guy but this wasn't doing it for me. \n\nAlthough I will admit this isn't the end of the world for food delivered to my bar stool but I don't think I would be happy if I placed this order from a table. However, this is the point of the experiment, no? Try something from the menu so atypical that likely very few people would order it in an attempt to test the integrity of the one who decided to place the item on the menu to begin with. It is that mindset that brought me back to Nan and Byron's for \"round 2\" less than a week later to try something more typically ordered.\n\nOn my second visit I decided to go for more or the full experience; grab a table and order something more typical. When my girlfriend and I arrived it was Friday around 9:30pm. Upon entering we were greeted by the hostess who was quick to ask us if we had a reservation. I thought it was strange to ask considering the number of tables available. Since we of course didn't have a reservation the hostess asked us to take a seat to wait for the next available table. Now, I'm not sure if this was a ploy to make them seem busier than they were or possibly an attempt to limit the workload on their staff. Either way it is always frustrating to wait for a table when 1) you are only a party of two and 2) you can see empty tables. At the end of the day it wasn't more than a 15 minute wait so not a huge deal. \n\nOnce we were seated I began to take in the atmosphere itself. The setup of the restaurant is great and the design is appealing. I can see this place being a good go-to for a casual date night. As per my previous experience I can attest to the friendliness of the bartenders and could see a drink or two first at the bar before grabbing a table for dinner being a great date experience. Additionally, who could say anything bad about the decision to serve fresh popcorn in place of the old standby bread? Who doesn't love popcorn?!? By the time the waiter took his second pass we were ready to order and I went with his recommendation which was the meatloaf while my girlfriend went with a standard cheese burger. The meatloaf was okay in that the consistency was good, not dry etc. Serving size was good and the roasted corn was very good thought maybe a bit \"too roasted\" with some bites. However, although I can understand the difficulty in getting the spices right in a meatloaf it truly had waaaay too much rosemary in it. Unfortunately the overwhelming flavor of the rosemary overpowered any other possible flavors and made for a less than perfect experience. The mashed potatoes had some pretty good flavor but were cold in both my order and my girlfriends.\n\nI can't say I wont be back here but I'm certainly not going to rush back. I think this place is certainly worth a shot and with a few tweaks can easily bring my rating up to a 4-star.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I've eaten here several times I have never been disappointed. My friends and I like to go for dinner and drinks and stay and hang out at the bar after. I have also brought friends from out of town here, and will be bringing my parents when they come to visit. The restaurant is warm and inviting, and the energy is always up no matter what time of day it is. Sometimes it takes a minute to get your table (and yes, you need a weekend dinner res), but once you're seated the service is FAST. I have been to nan's several times and I am still noticing new things about the décor. It is clean and modern but has a lot of rich, interesting touches. From the ceiling to the floors, they did a great job...seriously, look up when you're in there :)\n\nSo far I've had the kitchen sink salad, added chicken with the siracha ranch. It was awesome...its not exactly a healthy salad (it has chips on it) but it was delicious & different. I've also had the chicken, got the mashed potatoes and corn as my sides. One of my favorite meals. The appetizers are great - peppadew poppers and train wreck fries are my favorites. My friends are still raving about how good the meatloaf is. \n\nThe drinks are very different - they put a unique twist on classic cocktails. I've tried the Jalapeno margarita, sparkling mojito, farmhouse lemonade, g'night moon, and the refashioned. I like all of them - favorite is the refashioned, and my girlfriends are huge fans of the lemonade and mojito. The margarita has a little kick to it but just enough.\n\nOn weekend nights the bar scene is pretty good. A lot of locals from the south end come in and the crowd is casual yet classy. Saturday nights there's a DJ and I've seen a few dance parties breakout...its always a good time. \n\nOverall, I love this place, and I'm excited for the warm weather - looking forward to enjoying drinks and food out on the patio. Glad the south end got such a wonderful new addition!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

We were seated around other tables being waited on and everyone working clearly saw we needed service. It was rather busy for Sunday brunch but they clearly had enough staff working at the time for the volume of people. For the rest of the meal, the waiter's attention was spotty at best and only checked on our table a few times. \n\nMoving on to the food, two in our party had the brunch buffet ($21 with a drink) and I ordered an omelette off the menu.  The waiter managed to spill coffee while filling a cup and walked off without attempting or offering to clean it up. We had to ask a nearby waitress at another table for something to clean it up. The impression I got from the two who ordered the buffet were disappointed with it being mediocre at best. The crab legs (selling point of the buffet) were overcooked and almost not worth the hassle or effort. The rest of the items were average and were on par with something you'd get from a mass catered event. Definitely not warranting of the $21 price. They were done with their second plates before I received my simple omelette with toast and home fries. The omelette was horribly overcooked and bland and they cut up sausage links (served on the buffet) to use in the omelette. I could have cooked a better one at home in 5% of the time it took to receive my plate. \n\nWe also overheard\/saw two other tables that had issues with their food or service and were being comp'ed or receiving discounts for their meals. Clearly there were multiple issues going on outside of just our table and experience. I am definitely puzzled why this restaurant was as busy as it was and with many positive reviews. \n\nI will not return.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Although my home never served up portobello stuffed mushrooms...I ordered that with a side of peas and carrots. Delicious! Hubs ordered the chicken and stopped talking to me over dinner because he couldn't break away from the meal. \n\nParking is free (like I keep reading from their tweets). However, the parking can be a challenge, unless you are early birds like we are. It's rather small and if the entire restaurant is full you'll need to find parking elsewhere. When we were leaving other patrons were desperately looking for a place to park. Quickly eyeing us leaving a prime  front-row spot, they stuck the car in reverse, and was happy as a lark to get our spot. \n\nNoise level can get quite rowdy. It's an intimate, rustic setting, but not much to absorb the chatter from all the busy tables. We visited during a holiday party time and it got quite loud.

Of course, I might just be remembering Vinnie's, and they've done a great job reimagining the place. It looks great. Staff up front is fiendishly friendly as well.\n\nOn the downside, the bar can get incredibly loud if you're there at the wrong time, which is to say if they are busy and you really don't want to be in a bar, but would rather just sit and have a nice dinner. The problem with this is that there are a few tables in the bar section, which is where they may seat you. Fine if you want to sit in a bar, but not so much if you want dinner.\n\nI will certainly second the popcorn that is brought out with a nice kick to it - very cool, and something you don't often see (I'm sure it's cheaper than bread too, but that doesn't really matter). The only problem is that there isn't a great way to get it out of the basket and onto the plates they give you - not a good choice if you're at a large table of people who don't really know each other. Having bowls or spoons or something would help here, and speaking of large table, we went through that popcorn in no time flat, and it was never refilled. Even chips at a lower-end Mexican place get refilled, so not sure if it usually is or if we hit them on a bad night, but we didn't see any more popcorn.\n\nThe menu was actually really interesting, but poblano cheese served with house-made chips had great flavor, coupled with a strange consistency to the cheese made things seem really off. On the plus side, we ran out of chips on this dish, and those were replenished quickly. Guess they had more chips, but not more popcorn. The poppers were odd - you take a bite, and half of the breading falls onto the plate, while a large chunk of pepper remains in your mouth, and most of the cheese drips onto the plate in the form of grease. Not the best presentation I've seen, though the sauce was good.\n\nOddly enough, the drinks were also refilled quickly - water, sodas, even beer. Maybe it was just the popcorn, but even dishes from the kitchen came out rather slowly, giving an overall impression of slowness to the whole night.\n\nWhen the main courses finally came out, it was a haphazard arrangement. The pork was a chunk of meat - and I don't mind a bunch of pork now - but little else, served in a bowl. Why serve a big chunk of meat in a bowl, with no bread or anything? Sure, you get a side, and that's okay, but a plate would be a much better choice. Corn (off the cob) is also served in a bowl, with no spoons, so getting it out with a fork is a challenge, and though there is spice available with sides, such as sriracha by itself or with ranch, it's charged per serving (and they don't mention this up-front, which is annoying). Flavors are good, but a bit on the bland side. Even \"crispy\" fries really aren't.\n\nIt may have been an off night, but I'm not sure I'll give them a try again soon.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Although we had a large party of 9, 5 of us ordered from the a la carte menus and everyone else had the buffet. It took an hour for our a la carte dishes to get to us. And there were only 3 more parties of about 2-3 people each in thise parties. So there is no need for our service to be that slow. When our food arrived, the home fries we ordered were burnt to a crisp. I posted a picture of the burnt potaties. We were saddened that the chef actually sent the plates out with burnt home fries.

I recently moved to Charlotte, and it was at the top of my list of places to try. I took my mom for restaurant week last weekend and was extremely happy with my choice. Every detail of the decor was so well done and I loved that they had the heaters outside. We were a little worried about having to sit so close to the table beside us but we couldn't even hear their conversation. \n\nWe started with the jalapeno margaritas and they were awesome! Fresh jalapenos and whipped egg whites on top. None of that fake lime sweetness that you get with some margaritas. Worth the $12. Instead of bread they bring out this delicious spicy popcorn that they put their wing dust on. I would take that over bread any day. It went perfect with the margs too. \n\nI started with the wings with the ghost pepper honey mustard and OMG they were the best wings I have ever had. Perfectly crispy and the sauce was great. I cannot wait to go back and have those again, probably on a Tuesday when they have half-priced wine! I typically don't like oysters, but anything fried is a different ballgame. I had a couple of my moms fried oysters that were served on a pineapple plank and topped with a fresh jalapeno and loved them! \n\nI had the salmon entree and it was very good, but I thought it needed a sauce. It was just missing a little something. I asked our server for some of the sauce that came with the wings. He was like ranch? That's embarrassing.

It feels really intimate even though it's not very quiet and usually pretty packed.\n\nThe food is always very good. On Wednesday night we ordered the cheese and meat board. It was delicious. There is half price wine on Wednesday nights so it worked out perfectly. My boyfriend got the burger, which he loves there, and I got the Burrata salad with Salmon for the first time. It was my favorite thing I have ever ordered there and one of my favorite salads ever. SO good.\n\nWhile the service can be very hit or miss here, my experience on Wednesday night was great. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and never pushy. I do wish their service was more consistent. \n\nOne last tip- is you like sweet drinks, order their signature strawberry lemonade vodka drink! So refreshing and not overly sugary.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

A decent number of standard-fare breakfast items (scrambled eggs, pancakes, bacon\/sausage) paired with a nice selection of unique savory fare (shrimp n' grits, fried chicken, crab legs, oysters). Everything was cooked really well and kept reasonably fresh in the buffet. The shrimp n' grits were by far my favorite.\n\nMy only negative comment (which wasn't bad enough to warrant removal of any stars) is that the buffet setup itself was a little awkward. It was difficult to open up the buffet platters without the platters sliding around and feeling like they were going to fall off the table. There was also a metal bar attached to the sneeze-guard that ran across the front of the buffet that made it difficult to maneuver when serving yourself. Minor issue but could stand to be improved.\n\nOverall I was really impressed. It's probably been one of my favorite meals so far in Charlotte.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

My fiancé ordered the steak with corn and mac n cheese. He loved it.  For dessert we ordered the brownie with homemade peanut butter ice cream.

It's cozy, and is very different than most of the other South End restaurants. It's 5Church's sister restaurant, so expect to see some similar ingredients, but the asthetic is VERY different. Whether sitting at the bar, or in a table in the main room, its cool vibe and comfortable atmosphere is great.\nWednesday nights to Saturday nights are crazy, so make sure you make reservations! They're open 7 days a week, including a brunch menu (that will soon transform to a brunch buffet..think Heist Brewery). The portions are huge, and you get Cayenne spiced popcorn to start. Like many places in South End, it's more on the casual side. They're known for their comfort foods, and additions of spice (like siracha or jalapeno) in their menu options.\n\nDrinks to try: Jalapeno Margarita, South End Gin, Refashioned\nThe Jalapeno Margarita is topped with their signature Grand Marnier \"cadillac foam\"...which I would basically like to just pour in my mouth.\n\nFood to check out: Beet Burger, Chicken\n\nSides: Winter Roasted Brussel Sprouts (if they have them, they're a special option off the menu), Mac & Cheese\n\nI'll be honest, I'm a past employee from Nan's, but wouldn't write this review in bias. However, from knowing all of the  \"behind the scenes\" action, I can tell you that the service expectations are higher than many restaurants around Charlotte. Management trains staff to be fully knowledgable on the product and service standards, and it absolutely shows. Servers and bartenders live and breathe the menu, so if you have any dietary questions\/restrictions, be sure to tell them!","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

My arugula salad with chilled shrimp didn't have any taste to it.  I figured the shrimp would have been grilled...not like a shrimp cocktail on top of lettuce.  Boring.  Hubs ordered the meatloaf and it tasted as if it were frozen, they thawed it out, and put it in the microwave and then covered it with ketchup. He wasn't impressed, and neither was I.  I had a bite of the mushroom dish and that was ok.  Lacked flavor.  \n\nBottom line, the atmosphere is great, outdoor patio area is really great but the food I was not really impressed with.

Her only request was recognizable food & an excellent cocktail list. Nan & Byron's in South End came highly recommended by friends & local media, and they did not disappoint.\n\nWe started with the Train Wreck Fries. These were amazing. The delicious fries were covered in chili, poblano cheese, sriracha ranch, scallions. We completely killed this platter of fries. We didn't finish them, but we made a pretty significant dent in them.\n\nBefore our dinners came out, we also enjoyed our cocktails. I had the 'Farmhouse Lemonade' which was Bacardi Limon, Strawberry Vodka, Limoncello, citrus juices, muddled fresh strawberries and lemon. Our table wasn't quite outside, but we were close enough that it was pretty hot. This is was super delicious and so refreshing.\n\nBrittany had the 'Nightshade Martini', which was Pearl Pomegranate Vodka, POM Pomegranate Juice, muddled mint and fresh cucumber. I didn't have any of hers, but she loved it. Her only change would have been that the cucumbers should have been soaked in the cocktail.\n\nWe both LOVED our dinners. I typically go for seafood, but everyone raved about their red meat entrees. They were in the process of changing their menu, so the prime rib I had planned to get wasn't an option. So, I went for the Delmonico. It was 10 oz. spice rubbed and served with crushed Yukon potatoes, crispy onions, and a red wine sauce. This was absolutely delicious. The meat was tender and full of flavor, and the potatoes had a really cool texture. Different from mashed potatoes and smashed potatoes, and very tasty. The cloves of garlic that came with it were also a perfect little flavor surprise.\n\nBritt had the meatloaf. It came with sriracha ketchup, but she wasn't sure if she'd like it, so she asked for it on the side. I didn't try any of this, but she loved it. I couldn't get over the size of the portion. It was a HUGE serving of meatloaf, veggies and potatoes.\n\nUnfortunately we both finished our meals, so neither of us had any desire for dessert. Well, there was a desire, but there was no room.

Very hip, eclectic atmosphere.\n\nIn the few times I've been here, I've tried a variety of things.  Most recently, I got the pork chop which is one of the more popular items.  It comes with a mustard sauce on top and sitting on a bed of grits.  The chop was good but the sauce was overwhelming and I had to scrape it off to even enjoy it.  I'm a big fan of spicy mustard but they just completely over-sauced it.  \n\nThere are some good drinks - try the refashioned if you like bourbon.

I had heard some good things about the restaurant and wanted to give it a try.  The atmosphere and décor are very nice.  We were seated a very nice table.  Our server came by right away and took our drink order.  Since it was our first time, we chatted with our server about some of her favorite items on the menu.  She was a big help and very friendly.  \n\nWe ordered a couple of meats and cheeses from the cutting board menu which turned out really nice - very nice presentation and tasty.  For my entrée, I chose the pork chop and my partner chose the meatloaf.  The pork chop was really good.  The grits that came with it were also very good and the fried jalapenos really kicked it up a notch.  Unfortunately, the meatloaf didn't work out so well.  My partner said it had a really good flavor, but it tasted like there was something gritty in it - like sand or something.  We told this to our server.  The meatloaf was immediately taken away and apologies made.  He decided to have the pork chop as well.  By this time, I was half way through my entrée and finished it while his was being cooked.  We were not upset - these things happen even to the best of restaurants.  His pork chop arrived at just about the time I finished mine.  His was also delicious.  \n\nAfterwards, we decided to finish our wine with a slice of the chocolate pecan pie, which was truly wonderful.\n\nThe problem came when our bill arrived.  I noticed that they had taken off the meatloaf and charged us for the additional pork chop, which was accurate, but more expensive than the meatloaf.  I was just a little surprised that there was no compensation for the challenges we had during our meal.  We came to the restaurant to eat together, which were not able to do.  We didn't come looking for a free meal, but a little acknowledgement would have gone a long way.  We've had similar experiences at various restaurants over the years.  As I noted above, this kind of thing can happen anywhere.  Without fail, in the past, there was some kind of acknowledgement in the form of a deduction in the entrée cost or maybe a free dessert.  We paid our bill and as we were leaving, I pulled the manager aside to see if they really meant to charge for the more expensive entrée.  He seemed to think the bill was accurate.  I explained that we didn't get to have dinner together and that we weren't look for a freebie, but a little something would have been a nice touch - maybe a dessert on the house - anything would have made it right.  I explained to the manager that this is the difference in us trying this restaurant again and us never returning - which unfortunately, is probably what is going to happen.  There are tons of good restaurants in Charlotte.  We'll choose to go to one's where the management understands how to treat customers when challenges happen.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

He is a self-professed food and drink connoisseur who nailed every recommendation with amazing accuracy. We had the nightshade martini to start (pomegranate juice with muddled cucumber and mint leaves to add some unexpected fresh flavor twists) followed by the kitchen sink salad and then the beet burger. Admittedly, I have seen that beet burger many times on the menu before, but immediately discarded it as a possible choice.

We have the most bubbly server ever!  Super sweet and made great suggestions since it was our first time here.  We came with the kids and sat outside but what a cute place with whole American goth theme going on.  Popcorn instead of bread? Sure, thank you!  A nice little touch.  My husband and I both had the gin cocktail with the cilantro syrup(can't remember the name of it) and it was delicious and STRONG!  We started with the mussels and sweet chili wings.  The mussels were okay but not the best version of prince Edwards islands I've ever have.  The wings weren't the best either.  The chicken tasted as if it were fried early that morning then reheated and tossed in sauce .  The kids were happy with their pasta and burger especially after being told the burger was cooked in bacon fat!  My husband had hanger steak maybe which he was impressed by and au gratin potatoes which he didn't eat.  After the server noticed he wasn't eating them she asked if she could replace them and he opted for the Brussels sprouts which were perfect!  My scallops were HEAVEN.  Cooked to perfection with creamy potato puree and Brussels and the mandarin oranges added a NICE FLAVOR!  The kids went for dessert which they were not impressed by but honestly I don't think these desserts were super kid friendly and I wish we would have been warned about that.  Nan's Oreos were homemade cookie sandwiches with almost bitter cookies and the plate was decorated with some sort of whipped beer concoction.  The s'mores cheesecake was okay but finished with what tasted like Hershey's syrup.

All their appetizers are good, the main courses however (at least the ones I have tried; 5 out of 9 of them) are below average. \nThe first time our table had a few different items: The steak - which was terribly under-cooked, and looked so unappetizing that my friend who ordered it hasn't eaten steak since that day, two months ago! Of course, the manager apologized and took it off our bill, which was the right thing to do & that is why I would give their service a full 5 stars. Other items on our table included the Chicken entree and the shrimp pasta. The chicken I remember as being decent, while the shrimp was not memorable. \nOn our second visit there we had a good experience with the cocktails and appetizers, but again were disappointed by the main course.

I ordered the chilled shrimp with New Orleans spicy remoulade, then had the spaghetti and meatballs.

However, the seafood was a great bonus because he loves seafood. Unfortunately,  I'm allergic to seafood (and other things) so I ordered from the menu. I have to say that I wasn't very impressed though. I ordered an omelet with white toast. When I received my omelet there was wheat toast on top. I'm allergic to whole wheat and reiterated this to the server. The waitress came out and asked if I had an allergy. I stated yes (once again) and noted that that's the reason I initially asked for white toast. My food was brought out again but there was nothing overly spectacular about it. The home fries were hard and salty, the toast extremely hard (as it was old) and the omelet bland. I'm a true foodie so I am very disappointed when my meal leaves much to be desired. When the check came I noticed that I had been charged for items I never ordered or even received. The waitress seemed dumbfounded when I advised her of the additional erroneous charges.

I took a group of 8 people as I had 7 girlfriends visiting from out of state. I researched the brunch menu before we went because I wanted to be sure to choose a crowd pleaser. \n\nThe website said that we could order from the breakfast menu or choose the buffet. When we got to the restaurant the waiter told us that not all of the breakfast menu options were available and my friend (the only one who didn't get the buffet) could only choose between three things. \n\nWaiter didn't know if the bar could make a Bellini and took longer than normal to return with the answer.\n\nAfter a very long wait and many of the buffet-eaters being through with their meals, our waiter came by and spoke to my menu-ordering friend and said her food was almost ready. \n\nAfter an even longer (and noticeably inconvenient) wait, the waiter then came back and told my menu-ordering friend that he was mistaken and she couldn't order off the menu. Instead, she would have no choice but to get the buffet!! After that long of a wait and now being forced to order off the more-expensive buffet and he didn't even offer her a discount or a free beverage. Not only were the rest of us done eating by this time - he had previously told her that he checked on her food and it would be ready. Unacceptable service!\n\nThen he came by to pick up our credit cards at the end. If you've ever been to this restaurant, you know they put your credit cards on adorable, individual clipboards. After taking a very, very long time to process our payments (8 separate people, I understand) he returned to say, \"We don't take Discover.\" Could he not have noticed the Discover cards when he picked them all up individually?\n\nTo top it all off, as we were leaving we heard a different waiter tell another table about a mimosa special. Seven out of the 8 of us had just ordered mimosas with our meals and paid a higher price. \n\nNobody in my group complained once! We didn't complain about all of the long waits, about the menu not matching what was online, or my friend being lied to about our waiter checking on her food. \n\nWhile the food was delicious, having waiters who are not knowledgeable about the menu, the bar, OR the payment systems is unacceptable and ruined our dining experience.\n\nI wish Nan and Byron's much success (and a better staff training program!)","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I was excited because of the siracha ketchup that was on the sandwich, but was disappointed that the amount was too small to make a taste impact (they did provide additional siracha ketchup on request).  The taste was good, but didn't wow me.  I think the sandwich would have been better with a thicker slice of meatloaf which would better the meat-to-bun ratio.

I would ideally like to give Nan and Byron's 3.5 stars, but can't do half.. so I decided to go up rather than down.\n\nOur original reservation was for 6, but we were running late and they accommodated us by moving us to 6:30. The staff is super friendly. Nan and Byron's is very appealing to the eye. It has a funky and creative entrance that is glass and the door handles are a shovel and a 4-pronged rake. The glass immediately draws you in so you can admire the very neatly designed copper ceiling. There's a coat rack to the right, restrooms to the left and you're directly greeted by a check-in desk upon arrival. Past check in is the brightly lit and fully stocked bar with many stools to the left and 2 rows of high tables paired with chairs. The bar serves a good variety of local beers and wines. There are also TVs to watch sports or entertainment. To the rear of the main dining room, is a one-step up elevated booth area with 4 tables. Off of the main dining room to the right is another fairly large dining area with regular height tables and chairs. It is dimly lit. There is also an outdoor area that is open in nice weather and wrapped in plastic in the winter. The kitchen is off to the left of the main dining area.  \n\nAs a complimentary starter each table is presented with flavored popcorn. It is very airy and has a slight kick after taste. Two of us weren't big fans of it, while the other person loved it. \n\nAn alcoholic beverage was included in the Queen's Feast menu at this establishment. I choose Riesling, while my counterparts chose Absolut vodka with cranberry juice. One person tried a sample of a local beer called Copper. We had waters all around. \n\nMy personal choice of appetizer was the Cobb salad. I loved the lettuce. I believe it was green leaf lettuce and 4-6 full pieces were on my plate surrounded by sides of crumbled egg, blue cheese, avocado and halved cherry or grape tomatoes. I omitted the bacon, since i'm a vegetarian. The lettuce and tomatoes made the cobb salad very crispy and fresh, but overall it was more creamy due to the avocado, cheese and egg. It was supposed to come with blue cheese dressing, but didn't have any (or much), which worked out well. It was tasty and I enjoyed it. One friend also had the salad, but without the blue cheese and opted for another type of dressing. The other had sweet chili chicken wings. The first order came out cold and then when a steaming replacement plate came out, she decided she didn't like them and the other person who got the salad ended up eating a majority of them. \n\nMy entree selection was Grilled Portobello Mushrooms drizzled with charred onion hollandaise with sweet potato blue cheese gratin and Brussels sprouts. The portobellos had a definite grilled flavor and my two meat eating friends both agreed it was delicious. One even said it tasted like steak! Nice portion size, about 4 medium sized portobellos! The sweet potato blue cheese gratin looks like a thick piece of ham and I questioned our waiter, who said \"no, that's not meat.\" Haha. It was surprisingly very creamy and tasty, even though i'm not a big blue cheese person.. it was very interesting, creative, thinking outside of the box dish! I'm also not a huge fan of Brussels sprouts, but these were excellent.. practically my favorite part of the meal! They were halved, naturally buttery, crispy on the outside and seasoned well. I believe they were either just grilled or steamed and grilled. They were so good.. stole the show! I packed part of my entree to go and enjoyed it for dinner tonight at work. The sweet potato blue cheese gratin wasn't as good as when it was first prepared, but still edible. \n\nMy friends both ordered the filet mignon. They were both happy with it, stating it was buttery fall off your fork tender. It came with crushed potatoes aka mashed- they were good, but nothing to write home about and I think green beans. \n\nLastly, I ordered as a treat the Key Lime Tart with blackberry compote sauce, vanilla Chantilly, lime zest and a fresh blackberry. My favorite thing about key lime pie is the contrast and merge of flavors between the sweet, dry graham cracker crust and the tart key lime filling. The blackberry was a fresh, juicy reminder of another natural fruit flavor. I initially ordered it to-go, but ended up eating it all after tasting it in the to-go box! My comrades both opted for the s'mores cheesecake with graham cracker crust. The marshmallows are made in-house and surprisingly a toasted dark chocolate fudge cocoa nib is placed in the middle of each one. \n\nOur waiter K.T. was very polite, engaging, kept our drinks refreshed and checked in frequently. Nick, the owner also visited our table after the chicken wing fiasco. He was pleasant and apologetic. \n\nGood atmosphere, decent food and would consider returning!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Filet was excellent, pork chop average and tacos very good. For dessert, we had a brownie sundae, which was obviously microwaved. The first few bites we so hot I burned my mouth and the last few bites were inedible because the brownie was rock hard. The filet is why I'm giving a second star.

The buffet also comes with a free first drink - either a bloody mary or mimosa. After that they are each $2.50.

Our waiter was personable, but failed to tell us about any specials or give us a drink menu and when we asked, he described their Queen's Feast dinner offering which was strange since we were there for lunch.\n\nWe ordered the chicken soup, a side of green beans, and the famous beet burger.  We also let him know that we were in a hurry (due to a meeting) and if he could please expedite our order.  He was smiles all around, assuring us he would.  The popcorn came out quickly, so we munched and waited.  And waited.  And waited.\n\nIf this had been a full restaurant I would have understood the delay, but it was well after the lunch rush and there were no large groups seated before us.  When the food finally arrived, my girl had to immediately return her soup. The waiter had put his thumb on the inside of the bowl while carrying it over to our table.  That's a huge screw up.  When we sent it back he didn't even ask why.  Another service faux pas.  \n\nThe beet burger was as good as everyone said it was and the green beans were nice if a bit salty.  When half-way done with our food we asked for the check.  Again, we were in a hurry and let the waiter know this.  So we waited.  And waited.  There's nothing more infuriating than needing to be at an appointment and watching your waiter shoot the breeze with a colleague instead of printing out your check.\n\nHe finally drops the check off and disappears.  I put my card onto their clipboard then tried to grab his attention.  He was nowhere to be found.  I was reaching the boiling point when my girl just got up from the table, tracked him down, and handed him our check.  After all this BS you can imagine what my tip was.\n\nOur lunch was disappointing.  Even though the beet burger was fantastic, I couldn't really enjoy it because I was so pissed off at the inconsiderate service.  If the place had been slammed I would have understood, but this wasn't even a half full restaurant.\n\nNo clue if we'll go back.  Their menu is tempting, but what's the point when the piss poor service makes your stomach turn?","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We made reservations in advance and I am glad we did because it was packed! \n\nSeating:\n-We walked here so I can't comment on parking. We got seated right when we walked in. The place is pretty small so be prepared to be sitting stupid close to another group\/couple eating. If you have ever seen the movie Valentines Day, it is like the scene when they are out to dinner. Anyways, not a huge deal but I felt bad getting out after we were done eating cause I almost hit their table!\n\nDrinks:\n-I thought the drink selection was pretty pricey. My husband got a craft beer (about $6) and I got some white cran cosmo (about $9). My drink was tasty but I am not sure if there was any alcohol in there! It wasn't strong enough for my tastes. \n\nFood:\n-Ok this is where Nan and Bryon's earns its stars! The food was excellent!!!\n-Starters\/Appetizers: They give you complimentary popcorn that was awesome! We also ordered the fried oysters, which was the appetizer special for the night. Oh. my. gosh!!! They were so good. I have no clue what was in the sauce but it was this spicy tangy mix. Awesome!\n-We decided to split the meatloaf with sauteed corn and mac and cheese as sides. They brought it out split up on two plates, which is so appreciated! The meatloaf was incredible and the siracha ketchup was a perfect combo. It was a little spicy but I just took some off and solved that problem. The corn was delish! I think I could eat like 10 servings of that corn. The mac and cheese was good, not amazing but definitely good. The meatloaf is served on top of the mac and cheese and corn so beware that when you order two sides, they will basically be mixed together. I liked this cause our sides complimented each other!\n-Decided to forgo dessert but it sounded good.\n\nOverall, great place and I can't wait to see where it will go in the futre.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Bartender never brought her glass of water.\n\nHostess comes over and says our table is ready and to check out at the bar. Ask bartender for the tab, he says he has other thing to do. He get a drink for someone else and then he takes chair and moves it and gets preoccupied with other things and not with the customers at the bar area. I am still waiting to be checked out.

There were no complementary popcorn. We split the Signature Taco. The Beer Braised Pork was dry and had no flavor stacked with tons of arugula. As for the Taco- it is a flour tortilla- you would think it be soft but it was hard. Someone over cooked it. Asked the waitress is the taco suppose to be this hard when the other one is soft? She said that is how it is and then she says let me see and takes it and brings back the item in a softer taco shell. \n\nOrdered the Prince Edward Island Mussels- Not crazy about the sauce which is like Campbell's Tomato Soup. Was not my cup of tea. Have had way way better Mussel's than the ones they serve here.\n\nWe decided not to go for desert for we were not pleased nor impressed by the food this evening.

So, we split the Peppedew Poppers (try saying that 3 times fast without laughing) as they were highly recommended, and I ditto that recommendation as they are flavorful, but not too spicy (in-between a bell pepper and a jalapeño).  They have 3 soups to try, and we tried the chicken tortilla which was very chunky with lots of corn and good amounts of chicken.  It was more of a thicker brown mole base broth, but still flavorful.  I like that they have two salad sizes (small and large) for reasonable cost and allows you to have somewhat healthy start to the meal in a starter size.  We tried the side\/small cobb salad and it was just the right size and full of good ingredients.\n\nAfter all of those starters, we had to tell them to not to refill the complimentary spicy popcorn which they keep refilling at the table (yes it is good), we moved on to entrees.  Friend got the fish and chips which was done properly in the traditional sense, but not too greasy and she was happy.  I had the roasted chicken mainly because I wanted to try two of the sides offered.  The chicken was flavorful like a jerk flavoring and they give you a nice breast\/wing + leg\/thigh that are quite tasty.  I went with the brussels sprouts recommend side and peas\/carrots, and they balanced well with the meal (both good).  Needless to say, a great meal, and we had to each take To Go containers home.

From the front when you first walk in you expect a place that's gonna give you great choices of meat, fish, and poultry localized, and taking advantage of the great farm to table scene we have here in Charlotte, but what we came to find out that's it's nothing more than the \"college kids craigslist apartment of the culinary world\".  Not one thing matches each other. NOTHING! The decor and ambience were very nice, open floor plan, very inviting, beautifully rustic with an urban feel, but only leaves you with the giant question mark or sour taste in you mouth from wanting more. (Looks aren't everything) \n\nWhen we first sat down we asked what exactly was the concept of the restaurant, and we were informed that it's \"comfort food\"? The only comfort I found was ending this Enigma of a night and asking for the bill. \n\n\nIn regards to the food, poor selection, limited menu, no creativity nor flavor, and overall bland. Only 12 items that suspiciously resemble what I can receive at a place that's on the corner of 5th and church (hint, hint). It's like 4 people came up with an idea of what sells at one place, we'll through it on a menu, and add smashed bland potatoes, or a truck load of crispy onions, re-name the place in a different location and call it a day. We all understand Charlotte is not a culinary Mecca if you will, but this tom foolery is not pulling a fast one on anyone. I mean pop corn to start out at the table? Really? Something that's cheap and adds no complement nor nutritional value to the apparent question mark that's already lingering in the room. You just end up asking yourself why?\n\nThe one saving grace of this place, was something so small and minute that I wouldn't even call it saving. POPOVERS! Tasty and savory. About the only thing that actually challenged my palate whatsoever.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

My favorite part of Nan's is the décor. I would describe it as modern farmhouse chic as they incorporate natural wood, cowhide rugs, metal chairs, and rustic embellished walls. The back dining room has a garage-style door that opens up to a patio. Really love everything about venue.\n \nThe food features a twist on traditional southern comfort food with dishes like meatloaf, farmhouse burger, mac n' cheese, deviled eggs, shepherd's pie, and more. Nan's offered a brunch buffet every Sunday for $21 with a la carte options as well.\n\nI've had the Southend chicken hoagie ($10) and crispy beet burger ($8.5), both off the lunch menu. The hoagie featured marinated chicken breast, sautéed peppers and onions, lettuce, tomato, American cheese, and spicy green sauce. It was a disastrous mess to try and eat gracefully but was a delicious combination of flavors. Note: I substituted the American cheese with poblano cheese...Yum!\n\n The crispy beet burger was my favorite of the two and came served with boursin cheese, arugula, red onions and avocado. The crunch of the beet paired perfectly with the creamier textures of boursin cheese and avocado. Can't say I've ever had anything like this sandwich and it was delicious (plus light enough to return to work without napping!)\n\nI also had a bite of the Farmhouse burger and was impressed with flavor and texture of the patty but was looking for a little more of the barbeque sauce that was supposed to be on the sandwich.\n\nBoth times service was helpful and attentive, especially after we noticed a pricing error on one of our ordered items. Would definitely return to Nan and Byron's and am hoping to sample brunch and dinner menu items soon.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Nan and Byron is really nothing special. In fact, it's a really expensive nothing special. I'll take average food at low prices and will champion outstanding food at high prices but just ok food that breaks the bank, well, sucks! I wish I had just taken you all at your word and skipped this one. \n\nWe ate at the bar. The hostess was fairly unfriendly but the jovial bartenders made up for her. Beer selection on draught was pitiful. They had a really limited selection and shockingly 3-4 empty handles. So, they had the space for more beer and a wider selection, just choose not to? I'm confused. Anywho, due to the lack of good, craft beer, I ordered the sparking mojito. At $11, this was quite possibly the biggest rip off of the night. About 90% prosecco (a glass of prosecco would have only run me $6, btw) and 10% mojito, I was disappointed.  \n\nWe ordered a meat and cheese board and the pork spring rolls to start. Luckily we had a chance to make it through those before ordering anything else. The meat and cheese was fine. Nothing special but priced at $15+. The spring rolls, touted by the bar tender as \"outstanding\" were a serious let down. The appetizer cost $10. For 2 dry, bland spring rolls. That's $5 per spring roll for all the math majors out there. \n\nAfter realizing this place was not worth the money, we choose to pay out tab (over $50 for 2 drinks and 2 apps!) and leave. I found myself wishing we'd gone to just about any other spot on South or East Blvd. Lesson learned!","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We valeted our car (which was complimentary that evening) because apparently there typically isn't enough parking in that lot. \n\nWe were seated immediately upon arriving and our server was energetic and helpful, although she did seem a bit nervous but, hey, it was their first weekend being open! \n\nWe ordered several things from the menu and a couple items stuck out: the siracha meatloaf and cheesecake. The pricing seemed to be fair considering the menu items were more of a casual fare than sister restaurant 5Church. The atmosphere of the restaurant is a bit similar to 5Church in the way that it's hip, classy and comfortable. I actually did notice a few TVs throughout the restaurant as well, which would be nice while eating dinner here on game days. \n\nMy only complaint was the Pimento Cheese appetizer was WAY too heavy. My boyfriend and I couldn't even finish the plate. I'm sure that's an easy kink to work out, though. \n\nAll in all, I would definitely go back to Nan and Byrons to try their other menu items, especially on a warmer day when the garage door in the dining room can be open! This pace will definitely be rocking during the Spring\/Summer because of it's fun atmosphere & open-air dining room.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I wanted to love this place but I just had a so-so experience.  I do plan on returning and will update this review when I do!!\n\nWhen I first walked in I immediately fell in LOVE with the atmosphere.  It was intimate and swanky and I loved the soft lighting provided by the tea lights at each table.  The vibe was definitely \"cool\" and the offer the perfect setting for a date or a girl's night out.  \n\nThe basket of popcorn offered before the meal was unique.  Don't get me wrong, I ate the whole thing and then some...but I'm not sure I felt it fit with the overall atmosphere.  \n\nAnyway, on to the main meal...\n\nWe started with the Peppedew Poppers.  They were very good.  They had great flavor and they weren't too \"hot\/spicy\" which I appreciated.  They were served with some sort of dill sauce and it just made the whole picture complete.  It was very tasty.\n\nI ordered the Peruvian style roasted chicken which has the bone in and was sitting on a cilantro based cream sauce.  I was given the choice of two sides and I went for the baked beans and sweet potato fries.  Let me just say this meal was wonderful.  The chicken was tender, seasoned perfectly and fell off the bone.  It was juicy and there was plenty of meat.  The baked beans were okay and the fries were waffle sweet potato fries which was unique and still good.  I wish they came with some type of dipping sauce though because every other sauce\/dressing I tried was incredible..why stop at the fries?  So that all sounds great right?  So, what's my beef?  Well, the meal came out lukewarm to cold which was NOT okay.  I didn't want to complain so I continued to eat the meal but I know it could have been so much better.  \n\nMy friend ordered the meatloaf with mac n cheese and the mojito fries.  Her meal came out room temperature at BEST.  She was not as gracious as I and she told the server (who took forever to even check on our meals) that this meal was literally cold.  The mac n cheese was super bland and the mojito fries didn't seem very mojitoish (if I may).  They were good fries but nothing special.  The server said he could take her plate back and \"warm it up\" which just didn't sound appetizing to my picky dining partner.  What was he going to do?  Nuke it?  No thanks.  Meatloaf can swing either way so the thought of cold meatloaf being reheated in the microwave pretty much made her and our table nauseous.  He apologized and offered to bring her something else.  She opted for the house salad that came with a peach vinaigrette.  Once again, FAIL.  The salad was just bare.  It was lettuce with some dressing.  There wasn't even a crouton.  Looking back on the menu I realize it doesn't promise anything more but geez!\n\nThe waiter apologized for the inconvenience but it wasn't very convincing to be honest.  About 20 minutes or so later a manager finally meanders over and apologizes in somewhat of a smug fashion.  He said he heard we weren't satisfied with the meatloaf and wanted us to know he took care of it on the bill.  I know that in theory is the \"right\" thing to do but for being a local restaurant with a lot of hype, I expected better customer service.  I mean, no kidding she isn't going to pay for the meal.  She took one bite of the fleshy cold meatloaf.  They still made it seem like it was HER issue, not theirs.  They should have offered a free dessert, a free beer, just something that made them seem to care a bit more and it didn't happen.  In their defense, they didn't know my meal was cold as well.\n\nWe did end up ordering the vanilla bean cheesecake that was covered in a salted carmel sauce.  It was good.  It was rich, creamy, small portioned but good.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our check we noticed the table in front of us sent their food back.  As we were leaving we asked why and they said because it was COLD!!  They ordered the meatloaf and the prime rib!!  They said management handled it very well so they were pleased with their experience but both sent their entrees back. \n\nI don't know if Nan just had an off night or if they were backed up in the kitchen, short staffed, etc.  I can think of all types of excuses but I didn't have the best experience unfortunately.\n\nI still plan on returning because I think they have some great menu items, they are reasonably priced, have a decent wine list and I love the atmosphere.  I just hope my next visit is a bit more satisfying!!","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Hard not to attract a crowd with that kind of synergy.  As the \"new kid on the block\" with plenty of social media presence, expect reservations are necessary, unless you dig the roulette of an open bar seat.  While parts of a dinner experience here are great, others are a bit more unbalanced, but should get worked out as the kitchen and service staff settle in.\n\nTable service begins with drinks and the delivery of popcorn to your table, seasoned with a little siracha salt and Sazon, a latin spice blend.  Great for munching, deceptively easy to continue devouring.  The staff will not let your basket get empty, so just be forewarned unconscious munchers.\n\nThe drink menu showcases a cocktail selection that is relatively brief but clearly thoughtful with ingredients like cilantro simple syrup and a host of muddled fruits.  Bitters also figure in a number of drinks.  I tried the Southend Gin and was quite pleased, as this gin-based drink rose above the sum of its parts to be both bright and refreshing, without being too sweet.  The wife went darker, with the bar's take on an Old Fashioned.  Again, the mix of fruits and rye whiskey was skillful and allowed each ingredient to play its role.  Clearly a sipping drink, as it was quite potent.  A small selection of local beers and a small collection of wines round out this menu.\n\nTo start, we tried the deviled egg appetizer, which comes 4 pieces to an order.  They were good, with a nice creamy texture to contrast against the firmness of the egg, but there was nothing really popping here.  Given the menu's prevalence of peppers, this felt a bit like an opportunity missed.  \n\nFor entrees we gave the meatloaf and the chicken a try.  Meatloaf was a manageable slab that benefitted from the kick of the siracha ketchup.  I had it served with a special side of brussel sprouts and the mojito fries, which are hand-cut fries mixed with mint and lime salt.  The chicken came with our picks of mac and cheese and a side of corn.  The chicken was a full quarter, with a smooth green sauce very sparingly dolloped along the edge of the chicken.  Sadly, it was a bit dry, especially compared to other local restaurants that focus on rotisserie chicken with South American spices and flavors.  Upon asking for additional green sauce to help with this, it was a bit of a poke in the eye to find a $.50 surcharge on the bill.\n\nIn both cases, the kitchen has a clear penchant for trying to present the protein on top of at least one of the sides.  Not sure why, other than the side portions (at least the mac and cheese and brussel sprouts) were quite small.  As in, \"we could count the number of pasta pieces served in the mac and cheese on 2 hands,\" small.  Same for the sprouts.  Both were quite well prepared, just disproportionately small, and this coming from a guy who strongly believes in quality over quantity.  The fries order was properly sized, but the very heavy amount of salt used made them hard to devour, even if I did like the flavor combo of lime and mint on my potatoes.  Unfortunately this was the weakest portion of the meal and is hopefully something that evolves as the kitchen gets its feet firmer on the ground.\n\nService was fast and expedient, and I like the \"all hands on deck\" approach whereby your food and drink are delivered by anyone who happens to be close when the order is pushed out from the bar or kitchen.  Even on a Friday night we got in and out in just under an hour.  If that sounds a bit rushed, you're right, though our server was always gracious to check in without being too pushy.  A slightly more relaxed pace would suit the vibe inside, though, and this is something that should settle down as time wears on. \n\nWhile this first menu might not be a true foodie stop for truly inventive cuisine, it shows there are many sparks of promise here and the kitchen is led by a team from which great things are expected.  So I certainly will come back, sample through more of the menu and then watch as things evolve.  The space is great and the drinks are, alone, worth a trip in.  With time, and a settling in, this restaurant will be an asset to the city and a welcome addition to dining and drink options in Southend.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I didn't want to like this place.  All I could think of was...\"Gee whiz.  Another American comfort food restaurant. How boring!\". Since it's by the folks who run the chic and upscale 5 Church in Uptown, I also (incorrectly) assumed this would be the same \"see-and-be-seen\" trendy atmosphere, not something suited for the South End, where the vibe is decidedly more eclectic, casual and laid-back. \n\nBut since N&B's opened, I've been at LEAST 10 times (No joke!  It's close to work) and every time the food has been delicious, the service fast and friendly, and just like my friends and coworkers say...reasonably priced and unpretentious. \n\nFirst off, yes, there are staples like grilled cheese and tomato soup, prime rib, and spaghetti and meatballs. These are all fine.  But what stands out, and is simply fantastic?  The beet burger (lunch and dinner) and the meatloaf burger (only for lunch). \n\nLet me wax poetic for a moment about the glory of the beet burger.  This genius burger includes crunchy deep fried slices of beet, goat cheese, avocado, onion, greens, buttery soft bun.  This makes for a very good sensory experience.  Add a side of greens with peach vinaigrette, and it makes for a really satisfying meal for $8.50. \n\nDid I mention, I don't really like beets? \n\nThe new meatloaf burger is a relatively thin slice of their silky, meaty meatloaf, griddled with Sriracha hot sauce ketchup.  It too is excellent...and not like your traditional meat loafs. \n\nThe atmosphere is casual and comfortable...a complete 180 from the old Vinny's Raw Bar decor.  This means my husband can wear workout gear, while I wear work clothes, and we can dine together and not worry about feeling out of place. \n\nBONUS: The food comes out fast.  Also, instead of bread, you get a basket of salt and pepper popcorn, which is a nice snack and change of pace to bloat-inducing bread and butter. \n\nTIP: People who don't want to valet for dinner service, park at the Rite Aid lot and walk about 25 feet over.  Note...the Rite Aid says they'll tow anybody who isn't a customer...but after 10+ meals here, I have yet to witness or experience this myself.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

To start out we ordered the SouthEnd Gin, Farmhouse Lemonade and the NightShade martini. The drinks were refreshing, though the favorite was the Lemondae. We started off with shrimp cocktail and spicy cocktail sauce. ($10.50 for 5 good sized shrimp). The Prince Edward mussels in a wine and crushed tomato cream sauce ($11) and the sushi grade tuna tartar ($10). Both were very good and I would order both as a main entree. One disappointment was that the mussels came with one thin slab of bread. There were 5 of us sharing the mussels, which had been suggested as a good appetizer to share. When we asked for more bread to soak up the delicious sauce, the waiter came out with one more slice. We then asked again for some more bread and they came out with a longer slice of bread (WTH????). We decided to take the sauce to go and get a loaf of bread on the way home because we were obviously going nowhere with this. (Management needs to rethink this - going to George's Brassiere for our favorite mussels there is no shortage of bread). There were plenty of mussels for the 5 of us to share and the Tuna Tartar was split by 4 of us. (Those 2 are the best deals for the money) The entrees that were ordered were the pan seared scallops, pan roasted chicken, seared tuna and grilled salmon and the kitchen sink salad. All of the entrees were very good - the blueberry and blue cheese popovers were amazing!! The roasted brussel sprouts were something we all could have passed on - not a great flavor and I like brussel sprouts.

It was my third visit and her first. (My first visit was actually on opening night.) We had a reservation and were seated immediately. I was glad we got one of the tables that's half booth since those are more tucked away than some of the other tables. Our server was there immediately to pour us water and bring the complementary seasoned popcorn.  \n\nI had a sauv blanc I hadn't tried before - Frog Head I think - and it was really good. My friend had one of the craft cocktails that the server passionately recommended and she really enjoyed it. We had the deviled eggs appetizer, which were extra creamy and super delicious. I'm kind of picky about when restaurants try to get fancy with the deviled eggs, but these were just how I like them. For my entrée, I had the shrimp, which I'd had once before and it always delivers. It's shrimp on a bed of pasta sautéed with garlic, butter and wine. It isn't heavy at all and the butter\/garlic flavor is just heaven. It's comfort food without being weighed down with a heavy cream sauce or some other such thing. My friend had the mushroom, which came on a bed of quinoa with two sides - she picked the corn and the mashed potatoes. She said it was really good. I'm not a mushroom person, so I didn't try it. \n\nJust like at their sister restaurant 5Church, I have had consistently satisfying visits to Nan and Byron's and will keep going back. I've sampled several menu items at this point and have been really happy with everything I've tasted. The complementary seasoned popcorn is always a fun munchie with which to kick off the meals. The only problem I have with it is how hard it is to decide what to get every time. \n\nI'm looking forward to the warmer weather to see what it's like when they open up the garage door that runs along the front. I also have yet to experience their patio seating.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

We had no reservations but assumed coming in that early we could eat a quick dinner. We were greeted by two hostesses, which we relayed our 'no reservation'  dilemma too and they said - no problem ...but then nothing. We stood there and looked at them and they finally said..\"We will not seat you till your complete party gets here\" Okay, so we went to the bar. Which had 4 bartenders behind it. It was a bar for around 12 people. Five already seated and drinking. My husband and I sat down...found a bar menu and waited...and  waited...and waited. Its a small bar, the bartenders were right in front of us, FOUR of them..no one acknowledged us ..at all. After about 15 minutes ( a long 15 minutes ) One of them said without any apology, \"What can I get you?\" We ordered a \"Reoldfashion\" off the menu, a  13.00 drink. It was good and we were very thirsty. The rest of our party arrived and we were seated. We ordered the Peppedew Poppers for our appetizer, they were good, not great. The Cayenne Sprinkled Popcorn was great! That is free and refilled on the table!  We all placed our orders for entrees. There was three orders of Fish and Chips and Two Beet Burgers and a Philly Cheese Steak. I ordered the Beet Burger because I had heard it was unique and good, Everything came fairly quickly. I was very disappointed in my \"BEET\" Burger, It was to be fried beets with cheese and avocado. It was two of the smallest little slices of BEET fried and layed on this big bun. It felt like I was eating a burger with out any kind of actual filling - just relish. If you are serving a BEET Burger then have some BEETS on it , not just a tiny couple of thin slices,  I would not recommend this. My husband's Fish and Chips were not cooked, batter was wet and fish was cold so it was taken back to the kitchen. It took over 25 minutes to get him something to eat. They brought his back out and it was cooked and okay. The very best thing they had were the Mojito Fries and the Sriracha Ketchup. Fries were crispy and covered with mint and lime and the ketchup, well I love Sriracha!!

I want to give it 3, but I will explain what the 4th star is for in a minute.\n\nSo went in around 7:30 on Friday. There were only a couple people eating and a couple more in line ahead of us. The service was friendly, however, they literally scrapped the last bits of meat (chicken for myself, beef for my friend) into our burrito bowls. There's nothing wrong with the meat, but it would have been nice to get some freshly cooked meat along with the last bits of the previous container.\n\nAlso the portions scooped into our respective bowls was a bit on the lesser side than the other locations I frequent. Do people in this area just enjoy spending more and getting less than other areas? Was this a one time thing? Not sure. I definitely don't enjoy getting small portions when I'm spending so much (and adding extra for guac).\n\nThen my friend wanted chips and she got salsa instead of guac. I can't recall for sure but I think the price difference is somewhere from $0.50-1.00 in the two options. But the salsa is literally the stuff they put in your burrito and as the mild one is basically chopped tomatoes is very difficult to scoop out of the container with the chip. So I would suggest not going for the salsa. The guac is pricy. They like to charge more for it. But it tastes so good. Nowhere else makes a guac this good (from my experience) so I would rather shell out the extra coins for it. Also the chips were disgustingly over salted. I've had chips and guac at another location and it was a decent amount of salt but this bag of chips... Oh dear.\n\nOne more thing, I'm not sure if I missed it, but it looks like this location only has one disposal area for customers... I was literally running around with garbage for 2 mins.\n\nSo for all the above I would give this location 3 stars. But then I visited the washroom. And it was out of toilet paper. I could have just made use of the paper towels for drying your hands. But instead I went to the cash and let one of the employees know. Within 5 mins she went and put in new rolls. This is what gets this location the extra star. They were friendly while serving food, and they listened and followed through on a \"complaint.\" Good service will always get you a star with me!\n\nI probably won't be back here again. I don't frequent this area and I prefer a couple of the other locations anyway. But this visit has taught me to always go for the guac with chips!!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I scoped out the menu beforehand to prepare myself. That didn't take too long since it's pretty simple-burritos, burrito bowls or salad. You line up and it's assembled in front of you assembly line style. There aren't a ton of options-rice, meats (steak (2 types), carnitas (pork) and chicken), some vegetables, beans, rice and toppings like salsa, guacamole and sour cream.\n\nThe restaurant is shiny and open with benches and stools. It's not really set up for a leisurely meal. The people taking orders seemed to be more accustomed to people getting stuff to take away too. I went with salad to save the 290 calories of the tortilla and my friend is on a paleo kick so wanted a kind of salad bowl without the lettuce but with extra meat and guacamole. I thought the server's head might explode from being asked to deviate from the strict set menu but she kind of managed. They were reasonably quick and not unfriendly, although I can't say I felt like they were thrilled to see me!\n\nWe ended up with 2 salad bowls-his with guacamole and we decided on tap water to drink for a total of $24. Gulp. These were not huge meals, by the way. They were moderate sized and served in cardboard containers. We were given cups for our water and waved over to the self serve drinks machine area. Between the 2 of us, we absolutely could not figure out where the water was and had to go back to ask. In case you'd like some, it's the teeny tiny silver button just over the Nestea one. It would have been easier to steal some Diet Coke really.\n\nAs for the food? It was tasty! I liked my pork and his steak and guacamole looked good too. I think the prices are a bit steep though and it felt quite fast food-y for that. Also-no debit! Bring your credit card or (plenty of) cash.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The only change is that they now offer a brown rice option which a great plus if you are trying to avoid processed grains like white rice. My favorites are the grilled chicken and the stewed pulled pork.\nI always get the hot salsa which has a decent amount of heat, and I also shake some of the great chipotle flavoured Tobasco sauce which the smokey flavour makes any food come to life.

This one is a bit far from my work, but I decided to walk the distance to try it. Conclusion: worst burrito place ever.\n\nIt was my first time trying Chipotle and when I got to the cashier, my bowl looked extremely small. I disregarded and thought that was how it was supposed to be. I didn't even have a reference because people in front of me ordered burritos. As I'm eating my meal, I tell my friend about how the portions are very small at Chipotle and she says that I'm actually missing not one, not two, but THREE ingredients that they're supposed to included at no extra charge (veggies consisting of onion and pepper, corn, and lettuce).\n\nI look over at the counter and indeed, an employee was dumping lettuce onto everyone else's order. I don't understand how someone could've fucked up so bad as to miss 3 crucial ingredients that's supposed to be in the bowl. \n\nI then go to Yelp and I see that I'm not the only one who experienced this! I unfortunately didn't get to take a photo, but there is one already posted on Yelp. The caption is \"From my friends snapchat, as he was surprised at my tiny bowl. Both were same price and instructions\".\n\nI suspect they are doing this deliberately to some customers in hopes that they won't notice the missing ingredients. This wouldn't work on anyone who goes to Chipotle often, but it definitely fooled me, since I was a first-timer. \n\nGo to Mucho Burrito or Freshwest instead - they're cheaper and the portions are way bigger.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

No MSG or any of it's other dubious names  'natural flavours' etc.  It's pure, well made food and none of it is GMO (yay no GMO corn), or mass factory farmed meat, hence a bit more expensive.   \n\nWe bailed on all the other burrito places when Chipotle's came to Toronto, as it is just fresher, purer, filling, and zero bloated, sluggish feeling after.  Clearly less salt is used here too, a restaurant staple to create flavour when poor quality ingredients create none.

They have a limited selection if burritos, tacos, and a bowl. (Burrito without the tortilla shell). They offer pork , beef, chicken, and a vegetarian option called safritas.\n2. The bowls and burritos are 8.95$ before tax. The burritos and bowls are both huge and made with ingredients that are usually organic or from animals that are farmed with care, which is more than most similar places can claim. For some people, this is apparently the same price as a meal at Canoe.\n3. The guac costs an extra 2.21$. It is made in house. \n4. Toppings that do not incur an extra charge include grilled peppers and onions, salsas, corn, pinto or black beans, shredded cheese, lettuce, and sour cream. They have a choice of three Tabasco sauce flavours as well.\n5. The staff at this location seem to be friendlier than at the other location on Yonge. They also don't seem to try to skimp on ingredients like the Yonge location sometimes does.\n6. The burritos and bowls are delicious. You will be hard pressed to find a better burrito anywhere in Toronto.\n7. They offer unsweetened tea for those who like sugar free iced tea in the summer. (It is in the metal container by the fountain drink station.)\n8. They sell bottled beers and a margarita as well.\n9. With the 13% tax, a bowl and a drink is $12.20.

I have my favourites (Chorizo in the burbs, and Bandidos downtown) but lately I've been all about the burrito bowl from Chipotle. \n\nMost burrito joints I go for bean and cheese, with all of the fillings I tend to find the meat takes over (plus I'm getting some protein in the beans), but Chipotle's steak has really impressed me. It's always perfectly cooked with some pink on the inside! The reason I go for the bowl here is that they don't grill the burritos so I find the tortilla a bit too chewy and unnecessary on the calorie front. The bowl comes with rice (white or brown - I usually go for white), beans (black for me), salsa (the spicy red tomatillo is truly fantastic, hot but super flavourful as well), and then lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and I pay the RIDICULOUS 2.25 for guacamole too. To me guac is a necessary burrito topping and should be included everywhere.\n\nAnyways this is a super filling meal but incredibly tasty. You can split it over two meals for sure and at least you rest easy knowing the ingredients are fresh and the meat is local. \n\nI'm a regular at the Front St. location but I have to say the Yonge location, albeit way busier, has better service. \n\nFinal thought: my husband has the app and it's really handy to pre-order if you're going during a busy time!

I hesitated on staying after seeing the long line, but we decided to stay. I got the feeling the lineup was always long, probably due to the quality and hype it got from the states, and its location. We were at the end of the line, and it took around 8 minutes for our turn to order.\n\nI got a good 'ol chicken burrito, with a mild spice. It wasn't spicy at all, so mild is a good choice for those who cannot handle their spices! I think i can go medium spice next time. The burrito itself was huge, but so good. Tasted pretty healthy too, so i ended up being satisfied afterwards. I also got their chips and medium salsa, which was around $3 which was pretty good, because the amount was pretty large. I really enjoyed their medium salsa - it was spicy, flavourful and refreshing. For my drink i ended up grabbing a beer for around $4.50 (they don't have much of a selection, but it went well with the burrito).\n\nI would recommend those visiting or working in the downtown core to try this place out.\n\nDisfrute ! :)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The steak meat were actual chunks however I did encounter some really chewy\/stringy bits that didn't digest well. Added chips and salsa was enough for both to share and take home too!

The prices range from $7 and up.\n\nI ordered the Lolos which came with 2 waffles and 3 pieces of southern style chicken. The waffles were surprisingly thin about an inch and the chicken,  surprisingly large. I was told the chicken was really small, but you can share the portions for the most part. The chicken wasn't flavorful,  in my opinion it lacked salt just a tad would've helped. The chicken tasted pretty low quality. The waffles were very flavorful though,  I could clearly taste the cinnamon they'd used. The thing about the waffles I didn't like was the soggy texture. The texture could be due to the thiness of the waffle. I didn't try any of their famous Kool Aid so...but they get a star for their service...everyone seemed alright and helpful. \n\nOverall,  I think I'd expected something grander than overpriced bland chicken, and limp waffles.

The food was good (I'll give them that-1 star) and our waiter \"Carlos\" did his absolute best to improve our experience (2nd star). \nThe problem with this establishment is the Management: If that's what you call standing around in the parking lot talking to people and doing absolutely nothing to help your staff on a busy Saturday night. This gentleman must be related to someone because a Manger he is not !! What I was even more surprised  to find was that when I went through a few more reviews that most of the negative comments were regarding the Manager and to date nothing seems like it has changed !!So here was my 1st experience:\n1). No reservations, there were 6 of us (45 min. wait).\n2). Oder taken within 15-20 min.\n3). Food took another 30 min to come and came out one plate @ a time (one plate came out, then 10 min. later another and so on) until they got to the last plate which took another 30 min to come out ( I like to Yelp, good and bad so yes I was looking @ the clock: In disbelief and to give an accurate review). So at this point we have been there almost 3 hours and keep in mind the orders were pretty basic: Fried Chicken, greens, mac & cheese, Fried Catfish, green beans and yams (most of what should be already in a pot-the only thing you need to do is season and fry the meat).\n4). We asked for a Manager, no manager came -twice.\n5). A server's chicken flew off the plate onto the floor, no Manager (next to us).\n6). A server was cleaning off a table and dropped the plates, no Manger (next to us)\n7) We finally stopped a bald gentleman with gold wire framed glasses who said he was the Manger (because the one we requested never came). We relayed our experience and the fact that by this time our guest was so upset that her food had taken so long (the last plate) that she couldn't even eat it. The Manager's response \"This is not the way we do business but we don't comp meals\" no eye contact but he repeated it twice like from memory (did I mention our bill was over $100.00). The Chicken dinner was $14 and It was not about the money it was about the Customer Service (but a trained and educated Manager would have known this) !\n8). In comes Carlos (the Waiter), who we let know it was obvious he had no Management support and we knew he was doing his best. Again he was apologetic and sincere and even took $7 off of the bill (it was still over $100 for Fried Chicken and Cat Fish).\n***So if you want to wait along time to be seated and even longer for your food, be ignored by Management (who could care less if you have a good experience or not) and pay over $100 for some pretty good chicken and fish - This is the place for you !!\n\nOtherwise spend your money somewhere else where they \"Thank you for coming\" !","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

My group was ready to go and check it out based on all the \"hype\" around this place. I don't hold the wait time to be seated against them. It was actually good based on how crowded they were with visitors. It only took them about 30 min to seat us. One good thing they do is text your phone when your table is ready. I thought that was a good idea. \n\nThe overall atmosphere is good. Nice music playing, lighting etc. A really good atmosphere. I think this place might be great if you were going for drinks only. Good menu selection, good prices etc. So now I got you wondering why the one star review. \n\nIt only took about 30 min to seat us but it took over 1 1\/2 hour to get our food from the time we ordered. The server only checked on us once for refills during that entire wait. He comes out and said sorry for the wait but we are busier than usual and I guess it has to do with \"bike week\", then he says your order is up next there is only two orders ahead of you now. Let me think about the definition of the term \"next\"...hmmm \"your order is up next, there are only two orders ahead of you\" well.....let's continue. A while later our food comes out and it was horrible. Let me repeat that horrible. I ordered the biscuits and gravy which is supposed to come with biscuits and gravy, eggs and potatoes. I ordered a side of bacon. What I got was biscuits and gravy, potatoes and my bacon. No eggs which I ordered over medium. The gravy was like paste and all of my food was cold. Not luke warm but cold. I told the server my eggs are not with my meal and he said they would be right out. This was no kidding 15 min later and they he brings them to me and says sorry but do you still want them. Are you kidding me? What type of service is this? The manager\/owner whatever is not doing his\/her job. This is not good ole southern food. I am from TX and you must be saying it is good ole Southern part of AZ food or something. \n\nI will not go to this place ever again. I visit AZ for business often and I am a creature of habit. They could have made a fan of me but blew it. I normally will give a place at least two visits before I give a review but the service is awful, the food was awful and the management was not prepared for a big crowd. The feedback I got from my friends is there food was cold, grits were watery, chicken was decent, atmosphere was great and service was horrible. \n\nMaybe this place is better when they are not busy with all the bikers but I will not go back for several reasons and will not recommend them to a homeless hungry person.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Indeed, every time is a good time for chicken n waffles.\n\nHowever, ONE specific time exceeds all the others.  That is, chicken n waffles as hangover food.  Nothing soaks up those poisons like a Tre Tre's platter with a side of grits and a Dr Pepper\/Red Kool Aid.\n\nThis is a perfect place to take out of towners, particularly because of what most consider a bizarre concept (until they try it .. then they're like all \"ooooohhhhh\") and for the cool southern-style coziness.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Possibly the best friend chicken I've ever had - golden brown and moist & juicy with excellent batter.  The straight-up fried chicken is superb, but I ordered mine \"smothered\" with chicken-onion gravy and it was soooo good.  The waffles are also great - light and flavorful batter with a hint of cinnamon.  And yes, Lo-Lo's proves that chicken & waffles belong together!\n\nHonorable mention: the sides.  We tried collard greens, fried okra, creamy grits and candied yams (some of the best I've ever had).

While the food was pretty good, nothing else was. The staff was horrible and rude when it came to everything from being the hostess down to waiting on tables. No one seemed interested in thier paying jobs or cared what thier customers needs were. We waited over 45 minutes to get a table simply because the staff failed to keep up with busing tables and cleaning them off in a timely manner when other patrons left. After that, it took 15 minutes just to get our waitress to pay attention to us only for her to leave half way through our service, never to return. An hour after ordering our food, it arrived with a completely different waitress who was able to salvage what was left of our good time. And did I mention there were flies, most likely due to the slow clean up skills from the staff. I wish I could blame being busy as to why we were treated so poorly but a good chunk of the tables were empty.

The menu is a bit limited in scope featuring dozens of iterations of their featured foods Lo Lo's delivers multiple southern-style sides like grits, rice and gravy, fried okra, collard greens, red beans and rice, fries, mac & cheese, and eggs. Make no mistake, one could easily fill up on side dishes.\n\nYou'll find Lo Lo's (if you're lucky) in the SoJack (I'm inventing terms here for the area south of Jackson) off Central. It is a small house-looking structure with a gated door on it. Inside you will find cramped confines that will have the loud and lively wait staff running around you with dishes and cups no matter where you sit. Don't expect quiet, you won't find it. Don't expect privacy, you left that at home. Come and enjoy the people and the food. It is worth the trip and for the experience. We are lucky to have a place like this. The Southern Kitchen in Tacoma was one of the few authentic Southern food places that I have found outside of the south. To have Lo Lo's bringing some culture to AZ is much appreciated.

Seems a bit dramatic, but they were professional, responsive, timely, their food was utterly delectable, creative, stunningly presented (the food was the star of our wedding).  We still, months later are told that it was the most delicious food any of our guests have ever had.  We were referred to them by our incredibly talented florist, Catherine at Layers of Lovely, and we are forever grateful for it.  Between the two of them, our small and simple backyard wedding was transformed into the elegant affair that we had hoped for but didn't know how to create.  As far as pricing, well, when we received bids from two large, all inclusive catering companies, we were discouraged (for example, one bid we received for 75 guests, plated with chicken\/filet of beef, cocktail hour and their bartender with THEIR well liquor came in at over $12,500....that's not a typo).  Then we met Cut and Taste and thought they had made a mistake when we received their bid.  They were around half (HALF!!!!!!!) the cost of the others.  We were able to provide all alcohol at our open bar, and Cut and Taste brought the bartender.  Honestly, our wedding would have sucked without them!  They made our day so very, very special and memorable.  I wish I could get married again so I could hire them again!  (Not really)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I have a few go to favs, chicken tom yum soup being at the top of the list. The soup here was overly salty, not overly tangy because I do love that. It tasted like a huge handful of salt was accidentally (or maybe not) added to it and made it difficult to finish it through. Not to mention the chicken tasted rather old and not fresh what so ever which was a HUGE downfall. I did also try the chicken satay, and I will say this was crispy and cooked well, tasted fresh, and had good dipping sauces along side it. I don't know if it was just a bad batch of chicken in the soup or what, but it was not good.\n\nFor my entree, I got the mala string green beans with shrimp added to it. Both tasted like they had been sitting in the freezer for too long, and not fresh at all and it really ruined the meal for me. And for an extra $4.00 for added shrimp that tasted frozen and not fresh?!? That is absurd. \n\nThe service was also okay.

She is not horrible, but literally  forgets at least one item off of my order every single time!!! Idk, why she wont use a pad & pen & old school it just like everyone else? But she somehow magically remembers to charge you for the forgotten item. \nSo, I ordered out one night & asked for my noodle dish not to have onions in it (onions are like listening to a republican speak- just leaves a bad taste in your mouth & a horrible ache in your heart). It was somewhat my fault, I didn't bother to check my food before I left... but I got home & there were onions in my food. Took the noodle dish back & was completely ignored. Although I was the only person at the register, apparently the cashier had their head so far up their butt they couldn't see or hear me! But anyways, the waitress was very rude and almost accusatory\/defensive. And acted like I was lying about having onions in my food, she then got mad at me when I asked if I could exchange the noodles for their spicy wonton instead & do an even exchange. She took my noodles back to the kitchen & then came out with an even more annoying attitude, saying that the chef didn't see any onions in my food & asked if I could point them out- are you f***ing kidding me!!!! So I got ticked off, opened a fork & pulled out an onion, she then said it doesn't look like an onion to her and continued to argue with me. \nWhen I finally got my spicy wontons instead she then continued with the attitude because the wontons were cheaper & it was too difficult for her to give me the money they owed me. You know what the difficult part was- me not stabbing my fork in her eye!

Because of its location, I never had high hopes for it to be any good, but I'll tell you - it totally is.\n\nMy personal favorite is the yellow curry, when it's done properly. My biggest complaint about this place is its inconsistency. Sometimes the bamboo shoots are so tough that you can't chew them. Sometimes the chicken is grissley. Sometimes the curry itself is bland. But when it's good, it's really good. All of the curries are nice, and the steamed vegetable dumplings are great. The egg rolls are very good and very big. The service has always been very pleasant, and it's always very clean.\n\nMy other complaint is that it's a little pricey for how inconsistent the food is. If I knew that it was going to be great every single time, I'd never blink at the bill. It's not expensive by any means - $40 will get you two meals, an appetizer and drinks. But for the risk that you're taking with whether or not the food will be as expected, I feel the the prices could be lower.\n\nIf you're in the Stow area & want a decent curry, take the risk. Just maybe ask for it without bamboo shoots.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

However, no rescue should over-promise and under-deliver and certainly should treat someone who cares enough about the homelessness of the animals to adopt, rather than buy from a breeder, with some respect.  I want to know exactly what I'm getting and not be told something is going to happen if it isn't.  I adopted a dog recently from here.  The rescue makes the statement: \"All adopted dogs have been spayed, neutered, vaccinated and microchipped\".  It wasn't completely true.  When I received records, it turns out only rabies had been done previously without Bordetella or distemper, despite the fact the dog was at a pet resort that required those vaccinations prior to the adoption, but the pet resort taking him in without required vaccinations is another story altogether.  Further, when I asked for vaccination information and then asked again during a medical issue only within a week of adoption, (it was an owner surrender, so they knew the original family contact information) I was not answered by Melanie until I prodded for a response by asking the volunteer Laurie to please get her to respond to me.  When she did finally respond during the medical issue, I asked a simple question about if she knew what he was fed by previous owners or the pet resort he was held in before adoption.  I received a rude, sarcastic response from her.  I explained that I was at the vets and the vet was asking, so she toned down her attitude a bit, but the first response was very off-putting.  Another issue: I was promised the microchip before pick up of the dog but that never happened.  Then I was promised it would be done during the time the dog was going to be boarding for an overnight with Melanie (the week after I adopted him).  My trip was canceled so I asked Melanie to please set up a time that's convenient for her to just do the microchip and I would meet her anywhere that was convenient for her.  No response.  Waited a few days and again texted her asking to give me a time that is convenient for her to get him microchipped.  Again, no response.  So I give up and will get it done elsewhere.  It's not the issue of cost because it can be done for a reasonable amount.  It's the lack of follow-through by Melanie to do what she says, in writing, that she is going to do.  The volunteer Laurie was great but Melanie, who owns the rescue.....not responsive at all and under-delivered what she promised as part of the adoption fee.  It's a shame she doesn't respond because she wants help with all the rescues she has, but once you adopt you are on your own without support.  Her lack of responsiveness will turn adopters away, which is the exact opposite result I would think she wants.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

She could not have been more accommodating and made it super easy.  Kula had to be neutered before I could take him home so I had to wait a few days to pick him up.  I was beyond excited to take him home and picked him up from the shelter as soon as I could.  I brought a check for the adoption fee and then also another as a donation for all of Melanie's great work along with all of the other workers and volunteers.

There is so much expense to keep these dogs as happy and healthy as possible before they find their forever home.  Even if a particular dog gets adopted quickly or does not need to be spayed\/neutered or receive vaccinations, the adoption fee covers the day to day expenses of the shelter operations and helps to contribute to the costs some of the other dogs may have prior to their adoption.

Two of four times we've had pizza delivered that was, at some point during transit, juggled vertically.  This, of course, causes toppings to slide, pizza to mush, and the box top to stick to the pizza top.\n\nNothing we can't fix with a knife... but... but... is it that hard to keep your tasty pizza horizontal for the duration of its journey to our doorstep???  Figure that one out and I'll up you to ****, ya?\n\nAnyway, I know Pizza Pizza isn't the best pizza in the world but, for our location, it's consistently good (if a bit slanted!).  Factor in wide variety available and the regular deals they offer -- in particular the pizza and a movie offer, which rocks! -- and it's hard to justify ordering from anywhere else when you've got a hungry crowd.\n\nOh, and for the record, best 'za ever is as follows:\n\nWhole wheat, thin crust, four cheese blend, homestyle italian sauce, pineapple, hot banana peppers, italian sausage, chili flakes.

Between the two of us we ordered: Chicken and waffles (duh), Fried & smothered pork chops with mac and cheese, green beans and corn bread, fried green tomato appetizer and a giant mason jar of purple kool aid.\n\nAs our feast arrived, I could feel my heart beating faster and my arteries clogging up. This was going to be a challenge worth fighting for. We started with the C&W and each put a half-waffle and half-chicken on our plate. My friend starts eating the chicken and I immediately go in a panic. \"What are you doing! No! That's not how you eat it!\". After giving him a long and passionate sermon, I bring a random server to our table to reinforce my lecture about the correct way of eating C+W. The server agrees:\n\n************You grab your waffle. Add a layer of honey\/syrup on top of every square of your waffle. You place your chicken ON TOP (either cut-up or whole). You cover the chicken with hot sauce. You grab your knife and fork (OR fold the waffle like a taco) and YOU EAT A BITE OF EVERYTHING AT ONCE************ \n\nAs he took his first bite I swear I saw unicorns and rainbows come out of his eyes. He finally got it. The sweet, salty, spicy, crunchy, soft, fried goodness that is a well-executed C+W. Its sweaty redneck sex on a plate. Its fucking good.\n\nAfter that, you could've given us a flaccid french fry and we would have still called it a successful meal. The cornbread was amazing, the mac and cheese was tasty and the pork chop was the size of an overweight chihuahua. The only thing not worth ordering was the damn fried green tomatoes: only 4 slices for $7, completely covered in salt, with a side of salt and some extra salt to go with it. Half-way through the meal we found ourselves surrounded by 3 servers and the chef, all gathered to answer the \"what are gizzards made of?\" question- all because they were afraid that we would be grossed out by the definition. We were all cracking jokes and enjoying their company.\n\nAs we were down to 1 fried green tomato and half a porkchop left, we started breathing heavily. \"I don't think I can eat any more\" said one person. \"WE MUST FINISH THIS\" said, well, me. Using every bone in my body to be able to eat the last couple bites, we took the nasty green tomatoes in a box and called the whole thing a victory. As soon as we sat in my car and turned the car on I grabbed my stomach and said \"I'm sorry, I need to do this\"- *takes off belt. \"OOOHHHH GOD. MUCHH BETTER\". I regret nothing.","useful":3,"funny":9,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

Lo-Lo's popped up towards the top of the list.  I've never had chicken and waffles before - I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken (waffles are OK), but wanted to try it out at least once.  This seemed like a good place to go....although I had a feeling the place was going to be overrated. \n\nWhile I don't know the Phoenix area well, the restaurant seemed to be located in the industrial boonies - the street looked a bit sketchy, and there was this ghettoish sign painted on a building pointing you to the way of Lo-Lo's.  There was plenty of street parking, and I don't recall seeing a parking lot.  It's a cute looking shop - shaped like a tiny house decorated with some neon lights.  \n\nThe place is small - I recall about 6 or 7 tables and the restaurant had most of the tables occupied on a Friday night.  Definitely not a place for big groups unless you want to take over the entire restaurant.  It's a casual spot - waiter service is casual as well.  You don't have a dedicated waiter - they have 2 or 3 people on staff to help the customers as needed (which makes sense for such a small place).\n\nI'm not quite sure why, but it took us a little while to order - there were a decent amount of items on the menu, but because the menu items were mainly combinations of the same thing, we were confused on what\/how to order.  For our party of 3, we ended up ordering (I think):  Baby Ray ($13 or 12), Lo-Lo's ($12 or 11), and Stupid Fries ($8).  This place should really be a $$ rating vs. $ - our total bill including tax ended up to be a bit over $40 including tax & tip.  This was just for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer.\n\nFood came in a reasonable amount of time - probably about 10 to 15 minutes.  Portions were reasonably sized - not too big or small.  We had 5 or 6 pieces of chicken and 4 or 5 waffles to share.  The chicken was OK - I didn't find anything special about it.  Meat was tender and the crust was OK.  It helped adding some hot sauce and vinegar to help enhance the flavor.  Waffles were OK - could have been a bit better if the outside was crispier.  \n\nOverall, this place was OK - it wasn't exactly a place to rave home about.  One of the people at our table compared it to Roscoe's and said it was about the same or Roscoe's was a bit better.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I opted for the number 8 or the \"Betty's boob\" which did not disappoint. It was a chicken breast and waffle plate. I also ordered a side of corn bread and a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice.

We came in about 5:30pm and it was getting busy. We waited to be seated and I thought it was pretty cool they had a couch you can chill on while you wait. \n\nWhen we were seated, our server greeted us in a timely manner. We asked for some help since it was our first time and he did a fine job letting us know what was popular and pointed us to certain things I asked about. I asked him to go ahead and get our drinks while we decide what we wanted to get.\n\nHe came back and asked if we were ready and we said that we were. We placed our order (Number 3, which is 3 pc chicken with two waffles, and a chicken strip basket with fries and a side of corn bread) and then he asked \"So what did you guys want to drink, again?\" Wait a minute. I thought we had already given him our drink order and instead of coming with them, he came and asked what we wanted. That was a tad annoying. \n\nOur order was brought out by a lady who didn't really acknowledge us. Basically \"who had this or that\" and placed them in the center of the table anyway. She just left without saying a word or asking if we would like anything else. Right away, we noticed we had gotten everything except for our corn bread. We waited for our waiter to make his rounds but he didn't come back. It took awhile but he came to seat someone else so the couple seated at the table next to us got his attention and said that they were missing a few items from their order. So we weren't the only ones. \n\nAfter a few trips back and forth to them because he kept forgetting things they were asking for, I got his attention and said that we were missing corn bread. He said he would bring them out. I saw him a few times after that helping other customers and that's fine but he came back to our table and asked how we were doing...without our corn bread. I had to remind him again that we needed corn bread. We were almost done with our meal by this time.\n\nAfter he finally brought it to us, he started coming around a little more. At that point, I wasn't sure whether or not if it had slowed down or not. I figured it did since he was coming around some more. It was kind of too late, anyway.\n\nWhen it came time to bring us our bill, he had to ask us what we had ordered today. I was surprised... He said they had misplaced our order. How does that even happen? I've never heard of such a thing...EVER. I should have just told him that service was lousy and since they had lost our order stub, I didn't have to pay for the food. But since I did eat it (cause I was hungry mind you) and possibly a little too understanding, I gave him my entire order again.\n\nSo we paid and started leaving and I saw that it was as packed as ever. Worse than when we had arrived. I didn't understand why he would have time to keep checking on us at the end of the meal as opposed to during the meal. Now, I do understand that he may have been new or may even have been too slammed but shouldn't waiters and any establishment at the very least come by and ask if you were doing okay? IDK but the service wasn't on par with some other little restaurants I've been to. \n\nAs for the food, to me it really wasn't anything special. The chicken wasn't like how they make it out to be and the waffles were still kind of dough-y. I may have gone at a bad time but it's a restaurant and they should be consistent. The chicken strips weren't too bad and the best part of the meal was the fries. I gave one-star for the food and one-star for the service. \n\nI guess I was expecting a lot more from the reviews and reputation Lo Lo's had...","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

This is not a place to go when on a diet or attempting to make healthy choices. You CAN eat healthy here (egg whites and turkey bacon anyone?) BUT it's no fun!!! Why eat egg whites when you can eat grits oozing with butter, crispy always fresh fried chicken, and waffles drenched in sticky syrup? Splurge here, it'll be worth it.\n2. The neighborhood this location is in is a tiny bit sketchy. Do NOT let this stop you from visiting. The place itself is not the least bit sketchy and the staff are all amazing. \n3. It's pretty small (they are currently building a larger space.) There could be a wait when you go (especially with a large group.) But the service is fast and the food comes out quickly.

She's never been there, and wanted to try them out too,so it was an easy sell.  Going in, the place was kinda small, but I've been in even smaller joints. I ordered 2 thighs and a waffle, and my daughter had 2 wings with a waffle. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the waffle was light and fluffy with a great touch of cinnamon. I didn't think I was gonna finish the whole meal (cause I wanted to bring some home) but the task was too easy. If you like really SWEET tea , this is the place to get it. Mine was a bit too sweet for my liking (thats why they only get 4stars, because of the iced tea).  Overall if you never been here, you gotta go.

The mac and cheese is out of control delicious. It has baked cheese on top, and it is super creamy underneath the hard shell.

Then you try it and immediately realize that you still have much to learn in life.\n\nI've always been a big fan of LoLo's for many reasons. First, above all else, their fried chicken is top notch in terms of quality and consistency. In fact, their fried chicken is so good, that it beats out a handful of more upscale joints that shamefully charge more money for an inferior product. Make no mistake, Lolo's does chicken extremely well!\n\nThe waffles, on the other hand, are just okay. I'd describe them as soft and flimsy, with a slight cinnamon flavor to them. They're not quite as good as some of the waffles offered at local breakfast joints, but I suppose they're passable.\n\nI've tried several sides over the last few years, including grits, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese. All are pretty well done and reasonably priced. Their menu, featuring various ghetto call-outs, is quite amusing, even though I'll probably never try most of the stuff myself. Their cornbread used to be my favorite of all the sides. It's still very good, but they recently changed the recipe that now includes actual corn kernels inside. This is a matter of personal preference, but I much prefer the old way.\n\nI insist on ordering Kool Aid. Perfect for an intense sugar high, it's the same classic stuff that will permanently stain your clothes and temporarily dye your upper lip - just like the old days!  \n\nWe've always wanted to try the desserts here, but we're just so damned full after our meals, that we couldn't possibly order anything else.  \n\nWhile not everything on the menu is flawless, it's good quality and it's cheap. I have very little to complain about and for that, I give it a strong recommendation!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

A BIG FAT ZERO FOR YOU. This is only for the Central Ave. location. \n\nAfter hearing all the rave about Chicken and Waffles I was very excited to try this with my family. We had never been to or tried LoLos. We were so excited to try it. Today was the day. Saturday August 20, 2016. We walked in the front door to the front desk. The girl standing there saw us walk in and disappeared. She just left and we were standing there. \n\nWe stood there for about 8 mins. And numerous staff saw us. There were a few older people standing talking to others in the restaurant. Two younger black men walked in behind us and we're just chatting while we were standing there. Again no one acknowledged us....6 min. We stood there another 2 minutes. 8 mins we finally turned around and left. \n\nAntwayn Jones and Berlan who were the Manager and General Manager, you should all be ashamed of yourselves to allow your staff member to treat paying customers this way. I certainly don't want to bring race into this but we can't help but wonder if this was because of all the racial tension. Needless to say, whatever reason it was you lost 5 customers and don't worry. We will tell our friends and family about this visit and they will tell two friends and so on. \n\nLove, \nKarma","useful":1,"funny":7,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Time for my double layer waffles topped with creamy, melty butter.  \"That's money!\" borrowing a gleeful phrase Guy Fieri always says in his Food Network show, D, D, and D. :)\n\nSo my two other pieces were the breast and thigh.  I knew what I was getting into so I carefully avoided the glistening, crunchy evil they call: the skin.  But I did have a little and it was packed with all the great tasting herbs and spices that make up this Southern style cuisine.  That is what makes it distinct from your mainstream chains.\n\nNow, the battle between the chicken and waffle, I give the waffle a slight edge.  Its not the thick kind you might expect, but its still pretty good.

Haha!\n\nEverything from the atmosphere to their coffee to the service was awesome. Minor slight was that they did not serve decaf coffee, but no big deal. I ordered a waffle with two drumsticks and both were cooked to perfection. It's a pretty good sized waffle too, and the chicken just compliments it so well. Even the syrup on the waffle was delicious. My dad ordered bacon and eggs and he said they were cooked just the way he wanted them. Only other minor slight was that the dishes are commonly served with a side of grits and you can't substitute it for fruit or a biscuit. Still, not big enough of a deal to detract from the overall experience.\n\nThe waitresses were all so nice. They came around and refilled out coffee and waters promptly, made sure the food tested well, they even put on the Steelers game on the TV that was close to our table, which we appreciated. And the cold drinks get served in Mason jars, which is so cute. I love it when restaurants do that.\n\nIt can crowded, especially during brunch\/lunch hours. My family and I went when it first opened at 9 a.m. By the time we left around 10:30, there was a line out the door for lunch. If you go for lunch, get there around 10.

It is in the \"hood\" but the inside is really nice. There were multiple tvs showing football games on this busy Sunday afternoon.  It was very crowded and the wait was about 40 minutes.  When our name was called, the hostess (speaking a mile a minute) said we had to sit at a \"two-fer\" or outside.  Mind you it was about 90 degrees.  I had to ask several times what a \"two-fer\" was before she finally responded and said a table for two. We took that table and it was TINY! I would have liked to have been asked from the beginning if we were ok with sitting outside rather than almost being threatened (which is what it sounded \nand felt like). Her tone was totally unprofessional. \n\nOk so the food....I had chicken and waffles.  The good: the chicken wasn't by Banquet.  You could tell it was the kind your mother chopped up and fried fresh. The bad: The chicken lacked flavor. The waffle was small and just blah. Not bad...not good. My fiance had chicken, catfish, fries and mac n cheese. His fries were undercooked and it was visible. He said the fish was good but also a tad undercooked. He said the mac n cheese tasted like it was missing something.  Overall, I'd give the food a C. I think it is very overrated or maybe there just aren't many options in Phoenix. \n\nThe service...two different ladies served us but once our food came, they forgot about us. A man I'm assuming is the manager walked by and offered us drink refills after our glasses sat empty for 10-15 minutes.\n\nOverall...a so-so experience.

They are always busy and with good reason!\n\nMy family came to visit, and I wanted to take them to Lo-Lo's for dinner. We all tried a little of each other's foods to sample different plates. I always get Chyna's Honey Hots. Six big wings served with ranch. There has always been a lot of leftover honey hot sauce even after I've finished eating, so they definitely aren't lacking on the sauce. They have a great flavor to them, and they're always very hot temperature wise and have a zing flavor wise.\n\nWe ordered the South Side Chili Cheese Fries which was a MUCH bigger serving than I had anticipated. There were 6 of us eating the fries with our meals and we still had leftover food AND fries. The portions are very generous. \n\nWe all loved the waffles and various styles of chicken. One person at my table ordered the SoulFood Platter of Chicken Fried Chicken which is chicken covered with white sausage gravy. This was also great. It came with a piece of cornbread and 2 sides. One of those sides were string beans and red potatoes. This was probably my favorite side that I've tried so far. They are much spicier than I would have imagined. So much flavor, I loved this side! The grits were also good for the side order. The regular fried chicken was also very tasty. \n\nThe prices are a tad on the high side, but well worth it for the portions and taste you get out of it. The restaurant is also VERY clean. VERY, VERY clean. I don't think I can even stress that enough. Not even a spec of dust on the picture hanging by our table. And the staff has always been amazing. Our bill for 6 people was between $80-90, which wasn't too bad considering the amount of food we had leftover and shared the massive plate of chili cheese fries along with our individual entrees.

Did a great job. Ordered #4 with two waffles and two chicken and it was awesome !! \n\nHowever, the best part of the meal was the sweet tea. If I could come here everyday for that sweet tea I would. (This is not an exaggeration. That tea was brought here by the tea gods themselves) \n\nHighly recommend!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Just works for me. \n\nI also ended up with 3 mason jars of Kool-Aid, which I love. As the Mrs. and her visiting friend are from Australia, they are not familiar with Kool-Aid. When it came out they said \"red cordial\"! Me not being familiar with this red cordial didn't know what that meant. I guess in Australia red cordial has a bad rep for inducing hyperactivity. Of course there is the sugar but then they also think the red food coloring contributes. Since we really did not need our 4 year old and 2 year old more hyper, I ended up with theirs as well. Fine with me. I will admit that I did not finish all 3. Those mason jars are huge!\n\nThe rest of the group, kids included, also love their meal.\n\nAmong us we had several different pieces of chicken (breast, thigh, wing), waffles, grits, collard greens and mac & cheese. Pretty much everything was a hit. The ladies absolutely loved the collard greens and we put away about 3 orders among the 5 of us. The mac & cheese (a JW recommendation) was also a very big hit.

I figured if I was going to eat at Lo Lo's, I was going to go for it. \n\nThe food came pretty quickly.

That being said, it was divine. Everything was delicious and, while I am not a big \"fried chicken\" guy, I must say that all three pieces disappeared quickly. Other members of our group sampled the fried okra and the red beans & rice. I heard nothing but happy sounds as our table of 7 made approximately 15,000 calories disappear. This was followed by groans and calls for afternoon naps as we all piled into our cars to go home. \n\nLo Lo's is one of those experiences that should not be missed.

The naive inner-workings of my brain caused by the culinary repression in the East Valley were so wrong.  So so wrong.  I will never forget the day I went to Lo-Lo's.\n\nSometimes when you combine two unexpected foods together you reach this special nirvana that you never thought possible.  For some people it is chocolate and bacon (tried that in a cupcake and did not like it) and for me, I reached the ultimate bliss with chicken and waffles.  May the clouds part and the gods sing hallelujah.\n\nWhen the husband and I went, we tried to keep it traditional and ordered some fried chicken, some waffles, some mac and cheese, and some cornbread.  Lo-Lo's clearly believes in the mantra that butter is better.  Everything is loaded with it, and I love it.  The mac and cheese was intensely buttery and creamy, with just the right amount of \"mush\" in the macaroni to make it down home and comforting.  The chicken is crispy, crunchy, greasy and flavorful... exactly as it should be.  The waffles are thin, soft and buttery with a hint of spice.  The thin and piping hot maple syrup was served along with the waffles.  I found the best way to combine everything is to shred your chicken as best as you can, sprinkle it on top of your super-buttered waffles, douse it in syrup, and then dive in.  One bite of this and you know what I am talking about.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with this place.  It's hectic and loud with the cooks and servers yelling at each other, but it's comforting and peaceful in it's own special way when your server smiles and hands you your mason jar full of soda.  You want authentic?  Go here, and you can't go wrong.\n\nLo-Lo's, I will love you forever, my body be damned.","useful":3,"funny":4,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

The ambiance is really cool as well. The staff is always very friendly and the place is always clean.  My only complaints is $15 is a little pricey for a plate of chicken and waffles. Also it's always so busy you don't really get the service that they I think they are trying to give you.

Despite the seemingly hip menu and twist on traditional black dishes, this restaurant has no interest or savvy in dealing with POC from the management level. I came in from California with my parents and we stopped because they had heard good reviews. I was fighting a cough and purchased some tea at the airport to soothe my throat. When we arrived here, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable, with our hostess Victoria seating is with personalised suggestions and our server Sir adeptly explaining the menu and clarifying Abby questions. After being seated and ordering drinks, the manage AJ comes and stands over me at the table. He explains that there is no outside food or drinks. I acknowledge and return scanning my menu. After hovering over my shoulder he then states that he is going to take drink. I stated I understand the policy and ask if he can either expedite my drink or provide a glass for me to finish while I waited. He ignores my request and states either take the drink back to my car or he will take it. He then proceeds to stand menacingly over me, refusing to allow me to finish making my menu selection and restates he is going to take my drink, finally grabbing it off the table and tossing it out. Afterwords he does nothing to check on or expedite the I ordered and avoids the dining area. Working in food service for several years I was shocked by the openly combative nature of the exchange, the only solution was HIS solution. I thought the customer was always right, it looks like at the Phoenix Lo-Lo's, AJ is always right. Shout out to the excellent servers, but I absolutely cannot recommend this as a safe space to dine for POC while AJ is around.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Our server was quick and pleasant and the drinks arrived promptly.\n\nWe mainly ordered some variation of fried chicken and associated sides with one of our party ordering the shrimp and grits.  Forty-five minutes later (the magic of texting and time stamps) the food came. There was no unprompted check in to explain why the wait was so long. When the food arrived we were told it was the shrimp and grits, almost like it was our fault for ordering it. \n\nThe taste of the food was OK. The shrimp and grits were hot but it seemed that the chicken had sat waiting for the last of the order to be completed. The waffle was warm and the corn muffins outstanding. The rice in the dirty rice was not fully cooked and the mac and cheese had congealed during the wait. \n\nI'm sure our experience would have been better had the food been hot and arrived more promptly or at least with some apology.

The place was packed.\n\nTwo ordered a water and lemonade and the third went for the sweet tea.  It was SO sweet and SO good.

They took a late lunch and waited a little while for their order so by the time it arrived, they were ravenously hungry and dug right in to the grub.

The waffles were soft and topped with buttery syrup goodness.  The mac n' cheese was creamy and rich.  The cornbread was fluffy and delicious.\n\nAfter the initial feeding frenzy took place, they began to slow down.  It began getting hotter and hotter, but they kept eating, drinking, and sweating.

I won't be thinking about a heart attack, stomach cancer or diabetes next time I eat here.

It was one the recommendations from our hotel.  It was a little out of the way for us and there was a bit of a wait, but it was worth it.\n\nThey have a great menu for everyone with any appetite.   I would warn you, this is not a place for those on a diet.  It is great down home, soul food cooking at it's finest.  Order a few things to get a sample, but you obviously have to get chicken and waffles.... they are good, really good.  The chicken was crispy and moist.  The waffle was the size of my plate.  It was light and fluffy.  A little maple syrup... some hot sauce... Heaven I tell you!  I was so happy.\n\nThe mac and cheese was good... not great.  The corn bread was dense, but not overly so. The sweet tea was a bit too sweet and needs to be cut.  My wife ordered the salad.  It was delicious.

There was a free valet. The place was packed, so we waited around an hour or so for a table. While we waited, there was a comfy seating area outside and water. \n\nOnce we were seated, we ordered the famous soul food platter to share (where you pick an entree and two sides, and this includes cornbread), along with a red koolaid. We picked the 3 pieces of chicken smothered in gravy & onions for the entree, along with a waffle and mac & cheese for our two sides.\n\nChicken smothered in gravy and onions:\nMaybe it was because I was so hungry by then, but this tasted absolutely delicious. Hot, savory, and crunchy, this chicken lived up to the hype. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and the gravy and onions added a nice salty (but not overwhelming) complement to the crunchy chicken. \n\nWaffle:\nThe waffle was great, and also lived up to the hype I expected, as this is one of the signature dishes. It was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The actual size of the waffle looks bigger in photos, probably because the plate is smaller than I imagined, but one waffle is still quite an adequate amount for one person. My SO said this was the best waffle he's ever had. \n\nMac & cheese:\nThis was disappointing. The mac and cheese tasted grainy to me, and the sauce was lumpy rather than smooth. The cheese sauce didn't taste very cheesy to me either. I would not order this again. \n\nCornbread:\nWarm, slightly sweet, and soft, this cornbread hit the spot. Great supplement to the salty chicken. \n\nRed koolaid:\nThis came in a large mason jar and was sweet, but not too sweet, making a refreshing quencher to the savory foods. \n\nService:\nThe complimentary valet was nice, as there were a lot of cars and people around. Our waiter was friendly and prompt with taking our orders, despite the very full restaurant. \n\nOverall, I would like to come back and eat here again, but not on an empty stomach if it's busy.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Lolo's is known all over and people come here all the time to eat so I expect a wait.  When I got there at 11 am there was an hour wait, I expected that no big deal, and was told by the friendly staff that I can wait outside on the patio if I would like to wait.  Well I walk through the dining area to find at least 4 tables empty and ALL of the outside tables empty!  If you have an hour wait, why are the tables empty? I am assuming they were short staffed but still unacceptable for a place that always has a wait.  After waiting a little over an hour, we get our table.  We literally order our food once we sit down from our waiter Chris.  Chris was really nice and stopped by from time to time to check on us but it took 45 minutes to get our food - just unacceptable.  We literally ordered CHICKEN AND WAFFLES ONLY!  There were no added items, no speacialty items, just the norm.  Also, I noticed there were three tables that sat down after me and got there food before me.  I personally LOVE there food and thus the reason I brought a friend of mine here to eat but waiting 2 hours to eat chicken and waffles is crazy. \n\nI hope that they really work on staffing!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

She gets our drinks ordered quickly and brought back just as quick. Our appetizer took no time at all to come out. FRIED GREEN TOMATOES in January! They were fantabulous! I also ordered a Melon Mojito from the bar and that came out super fast as well. The bar tender even came to the table to see how I liked my drink, which I loved.\n\nFast forward to food, all of our food came out shortly after we finished our appetizer. I everything I had was great. The chicken and waffles were just great together. I had a wing, thigh, and a breast. All were crunchy and moist on the inside. My kids who are hard to please ate every bite of their chicken strips and waffles. \nMy husband got the platter with fish and chicken. His catfish was super juicy and flaky.

It didnt help.  \nWe shared the green bean appetizer to start, and it was quite good.  Crispy, not greasy and the sauce was a great accompaniment.  Have tried their foods a few times and am always impressed with vegetable sides.  Their greens are incredible and I always enjoy the grits.  Ive been told by the servers that the greens are not made with any meat, but the flavor is impressive.\nMalazia's Focheezy Juicy Hood Burger was tasty, we also tried the traditional chicken and waffles which are always a good choice.  All the food we tried was well prepared and enjoyable.  Having tried the Banana Puddin in the past, we knew it to be a great end to our meal, but none of us had room to eat it.  \nI will go back to the Central Phoenix location again, and may even try Scottsdale during the day to see if the music is turned down at all.

AH!\n\nWe let the ladies know we were there and they (very sweetly) accommodated us, (probably because we were only two people and fit on a postage stamp).\n\nI did not have the Kool Aid, but an alcoholic beverage at the top of their \"drinks\" menu and it was FANTASTIC. I\"m almost positive it had red Kool Aid, vodka and pineapple juice.\n\nI ordered Betty's Boob, a perfect combo to taste their chicken and SCRUMPTIOUS waffle and then ordered Mac & Cheese and Cheese Grits on the side.  \n\nThe Betty's Boob was AMAZING.  The waffle was scrumptious and the chicken skin was fabulous.  The meat itself was juicy, but not in the right way.  The interior meat was a little dry, but the outer meat was juicy.  But I'm nitpicking. \n\nWe were told the Mac was amazing, and I will say as a Mac and Cheese aficionado, it was not good.  It was not creamy in any sense, and was definitely more Southern in style as it was Mac you could build with (thick).  Not the creamy type I have come to adore.  \n\nThe Cheese Grits were gone in a matter of seconds. I LOVED them.\n\nWe also ordered Red Velvet cake at the end, to see what all of the fuss was about and it was BAD.  The driest and least cocoa-y Red Velvet cake I have ever had.  The cream cheese icing is so cloyingly sweet, it almost hurt my teeth going in.  I would like to see their recipe include more oil\/egg to give a more moist texture.  \n\nI will say I smelled Collard Greens walking buy me all morning and WISHED I had ordered them instead of my Mac.  I will DEFINITELY order them next time.\n\nOur waitress was AMAZING and when I walked away from my birthday present under the table, a nice guy came up and made sure I didn't leave without it.\n\nNormally from food alone, this would get a 3, but I want to try a BUNCH more sides that looked awesome, and the service was impeccable. :)","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I had to let my food settle before I began writing. I am still in a food coma. I can compare this food coma to being Ryan Lochte for maybe 30 mins, because I feel slow and DUMB- Jeah!  When driving to this place, you better look for it or you will miss it, but it is kind of hard to miss with people surrounding the door waiting to get in. \n\nWe found a parking spot, walked in, gave our name and waited a total of 10 mins. We actually stood outside of the door for a minute or two before we went inside to see if your name was called.  I have been wanting to come to this restaurant for along time now so I am glad I went with my friend Tamirra. She told me to pace myself because if not I will get sick.  I seriously thought by the end of this lunch date I would be sweating grease and my pores would ooze of grease. I order the #9 lil amadi. I order it with 2 thighs and one waffle. It came out in 10 mins and all I can say is Oh my WORD! It was amazeballs.  The chicken skin was crispy and juicy and the waffle could have been in the waffle iron for a tad longer but it wasn't mushy by any means. For the drink, I just ordered a water. There were two girls sitting next to me asking what the kool aid menu was, have you ever imagined asking a server what the koolaid menu was for the day? The server gave the colors and the respective flavors. She named them off: red, blue and purple and then went into the actual flavors tropical punch, blue raspberry and grape.  Classy! :) \n\nOverall the meal was really good, the service was good as well. The server came probably a handful of times, to give us our drinks, take our order, give us boxes and the check.\n\nThe only complaint that I have, which isn't even my problem but apparently they do not allow outside drinks inside of the restaurant. There was a gentleman drinking a starbucks coffee and a server actually stood there and waited for him to take a \"last sip\" before he had to hand it over.

Celebrating a birthday and return from the army with my family we decided to go here...whenever my sister is on leave from the army we always go at least once before she reports back. Anyway this is not important what is is the fact that the collard greens were on point today so amazing so good slightly spicier than normal but amazing nonetheless. The catfish out of this world it was crunchy it wasn't murky absolutely perfect! Also important to the story you should know that I literally get paid to taste it is my job I'm a chef. Now here's what happened...I ordered the fried chicken and waffles for my children I tasted a piece of chicken because I noticed that they were not eating it and it tasted like peanut butter. Keep in mind that I am at a table with three adults and three children with one more adult also a chef on the way to join us. Working in the industry I called over my server and I mentioned it to him he went to the manager which is what you're supposed to do they tasted a different piece of chicken and proceeded to come and literally disrespect me in front of my whole family. The general manager told me that not only were my taste buds wrong but I should eat less peanut butter. Seriously eat less peanut butter? Now I sat there shocked but I told him the other adults also tasted the same thing he said they were wrong. Then the manager accuses me of actively looking for something to complain of in my meal to get free things. Keep in mind I didn't even order the chicken which he then mocked me for eating my kids food. I had catfish which I ate all of and it was amazing. Also keep in mind that I still proceeded to spend more money on a dessert and drinks but they decided to freeze out our whole table and we sat and waited for 25 minutes for our bill nobody came. When our other guests came to join no one came to take his order so he shared a water with me and ate the leftover food from the birthday girl. No one even acknowledged us we had to flag down another completely different server or maybe it was a busser to get our tab. I wish I would've recorded his response(manager) to me because it was that outlandish. So sadly my first yelp review ever is a terrible one.","useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

She said hold on let me see what I can do and five mins later she came back and allowed my friend and I to place an order to go. I was sooooo thankful and happy. It was worth it. She was extremely nice and my food was delicious. If I ever go back to Phoenix this is definitely a stop I will be making. Thank you Allison!

Love this place so much!! \n\nLet me start off by saying me and my boyfriend were going to phoenix to visit an old friend. I found this place online and decided to try it. Not ever been to Arizona, i admit the area scared me a little bit haha! we stopped by this shady looking gas station like 2 mins away from it and asked one of the employers where lo lo's was. He said to park in the back so we got in the car and started to search for it. It was about 8 at night. We drove into the back lot and DUDE IT LOOKED SO BAD!!!. Being a wimp i started to not want to persue the place anymore. My bf insisted to park in front and we did. Our friend went came and we went it. It was ... SO NICE INSIDE!! Very clean, well lit, and festive!\n\nI  felt sorry I judged it before i went in. I  ordered the number 9, which was chicken thigh and leg with a waffle. Filled me up just right! the waffles were soooo goood! tasted of cinnamon and the butter was light. \n\nI also ordered the red velvet cake because i love red velvet and i heard it was the best. SADLY I didn't like it. The moistness was really good, but i thought the velvet would be more rich and the frosting was too cheesy for my liking. This cake could be very true to how its originally made so that is probibly why its pretty different from the others I've had. \n\nover all 4\/5 stars!!!~ Will be back again!!~","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

As a person of color who has eaten in a variety of soul food restaurants over the past 35+ years, I feel right at home here. Maurice and his staff at the Phoenix location take excellent care of their customers and regulars. \n\nI always have the same thing: The lil' Amati; I have for years. The chicken is always juicy and the waffles are always hot. For add ons I will get the cornbread muffin and the mac n' cheese. \n\nMy husband has tried a variety of dishes: the chicken sandwich, fried zucchini, the steak and egg breakfast, and the salads; he has also had some variation of the chicken and waffles. His favorite is the salad because the chicken is good and he isn't straying too far from his eating plan. \n\nI love the atmosphere and the food. \n\nI have read a few reviews from white people complaining about the service at the Phoenix location. I feel like I need to preface what I am about to write: I am not calling anyone a racist or a bigot. I am not one, either. Lolo's tries really hard to meet the needs of its (suddenly) diverse customer base. It will not always hit the mark. If you like the food but are leery about being treated differently because of your perceived ethnicity I have a suggestion: try their Gilbert or Scottsdale locations. Those locations are gentrified versions of this wonderful minority owned eating establishment. Perhaps gentrified is a harsh word. My caucasian husband who grew up on Chicago's south side says, \"White washed.\" Ok, that's harsh! However, the non-Phoenix locations are designed and run to appeal to the markets they serve as determined by their geographic location. It is likely people who don't feel comfortable eating on the south side will enjoy the food and the ambiance in Scottsdale or Gilbert. \n\nThe food is uniform at all locations and it is still very delicious.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The fried chicken is tender and juicy inside while perfectly crispy on the outside. Great flavor as well, and not dripping with grease. The green beans are perfection! Perfectly cooked, seasoned, and had a slight kick (heat) to them. The mac and cheese was also delicious. The corn bread muffin was moist, buttery and flavorful. I was so full, but had to try the red velvet, and so glad I did. The cake is so moist and the frosting is perfect; not overly sweet. The only thing to be aware of is that bits of the red cake get stuck between teeth. Looks like those red pills you use to check if you're brushing your teeth correctly (epic fail). I'm just glad I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and noticed my red teeth before heading out to the next event. So,note to self,  don't take pictures after eating the cake and be cautious if you're on a first date.

It's so busy on the weekend parking is limited. We got there around 10:30am and parked  close by and waited about 15 minutes for a table. There's a very small waiting area inside.

Ventured to Arizona's version of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles and they did not disappoint.\n\nWhy Roscoes? Because i love their food. THe waffle is thick, with flavor rather than the crunchy thin crusts that many folks adhere too. There will much comparison to Roscoe because the other chicken and waffle places like Mrs. Bea's kinda suck...\n\nService:\nStephen was our host and server, and he was great. One of the best servers my limited life has the privilege of experiencing. He was on top of everything, constantly asking if we needed stuff. Keep in mind, it was super hectic at this hour and he just hustled. It got to a point where I can't even ask for anything because he asked first or was bringing it out... At the end of the day, he shaked our hands, and thanked us, and wished us a wonderful time in the 602. I was amazed how excellent the service was. Of course, with the exception to the skinny waiter\/host at Roscoes LBC, the service tends to suck pretty bad.\n\nChicken:\nIt tasted similar to Roscoe, even the menu had similar attributes. Nice and fluffy. \n\nLolo's Hot sauce:\nPretty damn good. Had a nice cajun bite opposed to Tabasco's vinegarette base or the pepperish mexican chiles. \n\nWaffle:\nDecent flavor but not as thick. I didn't particularly care for the waffles too much.\n\nKool Aid:\nLOL sugar and water, what can go wrong? THis day, they had red, blue, and green. Obviously, i indudged in the OG red. Upon asking to try the green, Stephen, asked if I have tried the Suicide. \n\nSuicide: Bottom was lemonade with blue, green, and red kool aid topped off with sprite. No Mixing!!!! and it was great...

It was in this small house and the atmosphere and food was amazing with wonderful service. Then they moved.\n\nI work pretty close so one time a coworker and I called in a lunch take-out order. From my prior experience of them being so busy I called well ahead of time to ensure it would be ready when I got there. It wasn't. I waited an extra half an hour and was told it was my fault because I called so early. Rude.\n\nRegardless, the food was amazing and I wasn't going to let that ruin a restaurant for me. Went there once more with my boyfriend and had great food and great service. A few more times had take-out and they were all a success. \n\nThen my boyfriend and I took two of our friends there for a greasy hangover breakfast since they had never been there before. We were told the wait would be 40 mins. After an hour my boyfriend asked what had happened and they told us we missed it when we were called. Annoying but hey, maybe it was our fault and we sat back down expecting to be first in line. The hostess then came out and seated a group of like six who had gotten there way after us. Annoyed and STARVING we gave up and left. And I looked over at the hostess just livid and she looked right back at me with this smug look on her face.\n\nToday was definitely the last straw. We ordered take-out and apparently they no longer accept payment upon arrival. You have to pay with a card up front. Thankfully I work at a bank and have an ATM on campus so I could deposit the cash into my account for the $70 order we made. They said we needed the card and ID to pick up the order and I told her I was sending someone else to pick it up, the girl on the phone told me she would make an exception as long as he had those two items. And of course they told my coworker when he got there they can't do that but luckily gave him the food. The chicken was dry and tiny and the waffles were super thin. \n\nI'm just over it. Now that Welcome Chicken and Donuts opened I'll just go there instead. They always have good service and the chicken is amazing.

On a Friday night, place filled inside and outside, it only took about 5 minutes for my mom and I to get seated. Our waitress was so sweet and attentive from the get-go. I wish I caught her name because I'd give her a shoutout. Anyways, you must must must get the restaurant staple - chicken & waffles. The menu has an array of different combination options (ex. Lolo's: 3 pieces with 1 waffle, etc.) and you are sure to find the one that best fits your craving. I almost ALWAYS go with the Lil C. It comes with 2 pieces of chicken (legs\/thighs) and a side of mac & cheese OR beans. The mac & cheese is a MUST HAVE!! And if you are into gravy and don't mind a .50 extra charge, order your chicken \"smothered\" and your chicken will indeed be smothered with their succulent gravy and grilled onions. In my opinion, this definitely hits the spot! However, during my most recent experience here, I decided to order the salmon croquette for a little change. There are several options for salmon croquette (salad, breakfast plate) but my server helped me decide on the salmon croquette platter which comes with TWO sides AND cornbread! I was so excited that I was able to get my favorite mac & cheese and buttered corn for my 2nd side. I'll be honest that the salmon croquette didn't excite me much. It was a tad dry and not as flavorful as I hoped. A 3\/5. But my sides were still wonderful. My mom and I saved room for dessert this time and oh my goodness. Their bread pudding is OH SO GOOD! Just the right amount of sweetness and a wonderful bottom crust. It comes with a mixed berry sauce and a little bit of vanilla ice cream. It made my night. Lolos is one of my most favorite local restaurants, hands down.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Its fresh, clean, simple dining and college casual environment appeal to the middle class pseudo-foodie in me, and it is to that restaurant that I introduce friends and acquaintances when they ask 'Where should we go for lunch?'  That restaurant is my public gastronomic façade, the place I almost dress up for, and where I know I will always end up, not because I am in love with it and cannot see it for its faults, but because I love it and incapable of comprehending a gustationary existence without it, my culinary spouse, if you will.\n\nLo-Lo's, however, is my lover.\n\nLo-Lo's, unlike the sleek, sophisticated, cosmopolitan Other, is the rich and rusticated temptress, a shadowy figure leaning suggestively upon a voluptuous Victorian balcony, or, in this case, against the brown stucco'd brick walls found between 1st and Central Avenues on Yuma Street.  The sharp, gentrificated Other demands poise, an appreciation for the obtuse nomenclature of Mediterranean flavors, and the quiet false dignity of petite bourgeois living: not unlike the maintenance costs of a promised cohabitant.  The artificial, hip vestments, gym membership, etc. all satisfy these demands.  Lo-Lo's, however, accepts me in the moonlight, when I am most exhausted by the petty realities of life, with my most basic of culinary judgments, paunch belly, and dimpled thighs, several of which were caused, in part, by my indulging in Lo-Lo's itself.\n\nThe chicken is succulent, always crispy on the outside, and never excessively greasy (if your definition of 'excessive' is based on a reasonable understanding of the genre of food that is served at Lo-Lo's).  The waffles are crispy and delicious, savory rather than sweet, and always served with copious amounts of sweet cream butter and syrup, so that even the most grossly over-indulgent might be satisfied.  The catfish is crusted with a simple cornmeal batter, perfectly seasoned, and juicy on the inside.  It's absolutely delicious with a light (or generous) coating of Louisiana hot sauce.\n\nThe majority of the sides are also delectable: the corn bread is served sweet-style, though not overly so.  The fried okra is plump and crispy.  The mac and cheese is some of the best I've ever had, and the candy sweets (sweet potatoes) both uncomplicated and complex.  The beans and rice are a meal unto themselves.\n\nThe drinks are very sugary, and unless you want to fill up on several hundred calories worth of sweet tea or (virtually opaque) Kool-aid on its own, it might be best to order water.  The lemonade is several rungs below both of those options on the sugary-ness level.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual, though not \"kick off your shoes\", casual; some of the staff live in the neighborhood, and they're very friendly and patient with customers.  Lo-Lo himself is often there on Sunday mornings, when the church crowds come to partake in his creations wearing their congregational best.  A Bose stereo in one corner of the smallish hallway\/first dining room area often plays Jazz music.  It can get very crowded at virtually all hours, as it is a very popular place.  Plan on pooling your money: they discourage separate checks.  The bathroom is small but very clean and homey.\n\nMy lover, however, unlike those mythological places found only in culinary rags and the imaginations of tunnel-visioned food writers, is not perfect.  There is, to a degree, a problem of consistency at Lo-Lo's: those ordering their fried chicken with gravy may sometimes find their meal slathered in a salty, caramel-colored sauce popping with the flavor of roast onions.  Other times one is confronted with a considerably thinner gravy of nearly-raw white rings.  The cornbread, while always delicious, is sometimes dry.  The staff, friendly and generally attentive they may be, is often swamped by the sheer volume of people coming in and out of the dining areas, and it is often difficult to secure seating for large groups.  Don't be afraid to ask for refills on your drinks if necessary.\n\nFor all its faults, I find myself unable to draw myself away from Lo-Lo's for any more than a few weeks at a time, like some strange, wonderful addiction that from time to time demands my submission, a temporal span which, I suspect, will rapidly shorten as I surrender more and more often to the need.  My friends and I even crafted a clever neologism to describe the unique sensation of simultaneous joy, victory, disgust and regret that follows most outings to this alluring outpost of gustational heaven and nutritional hell: to get Lo-Lo'd.\n\nIn any case, assuming a readiness for all its faults and its aftereffects, I would recommend Lo-Lo's to anyone not currently pregnant, elderly, a child, or stricken with some sort of malady affecting nutritional well-being.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

First of all my big mistake was going there on a Sunday, Palm Sunday to be exact. We were told there would be a 30 min wait, which I was surprised due to the amount of people that were already waiting. So we waited and waited and waited. Well 30 min wait turned into an hour wait. \n\nWe finally got a place to sit and waited for someone to acknowledge us. Finally we got to put in our drink orders! The drinks came in big mason jars and I ended up ordering sweet tea ($3), which was so incredibly sweet that I couldn't really drink it. \n\nMy husband ordered KK which consisted of 3 piece chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and eggs with cheese and onions. I ordered Baby Ray which came with 3 piece chicken with gravy and 2 waffles. We also ordered side of collard greens.\n\nWe then waited and waited and waited for our food which took about 50 mins! The waitress never once came over to see how we were doing or even informed us about our food. The kitchen looked like there was no sense of order and it was chaotic behind the counter. \n\nSo now on to the food. The chicken with gravy and the collards were the only things that were actually delicious. The waffles were soft and dense, it was more like a pancake shaped like waffles. The grits were cold and congealed, I'm assuming it would've been good if it was hot because the flavors were decent. \n\nBasically we waited an hour for the table, hour for the food, and ate in 15 minutes. I'm not sure if I would return to give it another try but if I did, I would go on a weekday.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

A party of 12 came in after us and were seated before us. Our wait was the full 25 minutes.   The woman at the front desk asked for a name to call when it time to be seated.  I said \"Darian.\" She repeated back Victoria. Umm no Darian, she laughed and said not even close huh.  She called out Dirk when it was time to be seated. If they turned the music down just a little bit (not too much because I loved whatever station they were playing) they could possibly hear their customers a little better.  The front desk person was wearing a t shirt that read \"Ghetto Fabulous\" on it.  Ghetto, for sure, fabulous was still something to be seen.\n\nThe food - Overrated and way too salty - so salty you can see the salt simply sitting on the Stupid fry.  My son loved the catfish sandwich and my daughter was sick from the tre-tre (two drumsticks and a waffle) less than 30 minutes after leaving the restaurant.  Serving the drinks in various sized mason jars was a creative touch - mixing all of the alcoholic drinks with Kool Aid is once again ghetto.  The drinks are super strong (maybe because they are mixed with Kool Aid?) I didn't have the waffle but just looking at it, I wasn't impressed.\n\nThe service -Lots of Lo Lo staff simply walking around aimlessly, chatting with the folks at the front door, walking in and out from the patio area, cackling it up with each other, not doing much of anything really.  I will say that our server is what made me give this review two whole stars.  She did a good job and you could tell (besides her telling us) that she was very busy.  She took our drink order and told us that she is also our bartender, so please bear with her but she will be back as soon as she can.  She brought the drinks and 20 minutes later came back with water and finally took our food order.  Same long wait followed by what appeared to be sincere apologies when we asked for more napkins and a take out box. She was very accommodating. Turns out she was also our cashier. Her name was Shamreya.   I ended up giving her the full tip that was \"suggested\" on the bottom of the receipt out of pity, quite honestly.\n\nParking - one word - SUCKED\n\nBesides getting sick, my kids (young adults themselves) actually liked this place - maybe because it appeared as if it was managed by young adults.  Looks like this restaurant stays pretty busy so they won't notice that I will not be eating here again.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We finally tried this place out after hearing about it from several of our friends and coworkers who have lived in the area for quite some time. We read a few reviews, liked what we saw, and made it a point to go. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and shown to our table. The decor is sort of a modern meets rustic look.  \n\nOur waitress Leslie came right over and took our drink order.  The menu is huge, and we wanted to try everything on it. Needless to say it took us a few minutes to make our decisions, but then we were ready to bring on the hurt. We knew then that this was simultaneously going to be both the best and worst decision ever for dinner. My wife ordered the Lo Lo's chicken and waffles, I ordered the 8 double D's chicken breast and waffle, and we got an order of fries and corn bread to share. We also ordered two drinks off of their specialty menu, a Keep it Simple for my wife, and the tropical drink for me. Sadly, I can't remember the name of the drink. \n\nThe fries and the corn bread came out first.  The corn bread was good, but not the best I've had. The fries are hand cut with a glorious seasoning.  Anyone who knows me well knows my unhealthy obsession with french fries...It's rivaled only by my love of tacos. The fries never stood a chance. Every now and then I would pause for half a second to dip one in ketchup, but they were so good they really didn't need it. Shortly thereafter the rest of the food came out.\n\nThe main course came out on large dishes that were roughly the size of trampolines. My inner fat kid was practically leaping up and down at this point. The amount of food piled on the plates bordered on unnatural. It was about this time that my wife and I realized we may have ordered too much food. We didn't care. We were too busy staring down our plates like two gunslingers before a high noon showdown and furiously snapping photos for our future Yelp post. Our stomachs grumbled with anticipation.\n\nThe chicken was delicious, juicy, and breaded and fried southern style. The waffles were soft and made to order with their special batter. I went all out, ripping my chicken breast off the bone and stuffed it in the waffle, loaded it with butter, syrup, and hot sauce. With a big grin on my face, I folded it up like a giant delicious taco and ate it like it was my last meal on earth. My inner fat kid was getting worried at this point, because he knew there was more to come. Syrup and butter streaming down my hands, I enjoyed it to the last crumb. The waffle split and threatened to spill its contents all over the table several times, but I'm no amateur taco eater. The hot sauce is medium, with a little bit of a kick but not too much, and a nice spicy offset to the sweetness of the syrup.  \n\nThroughout the course of our meal, our table was visited several times by our waitress and other staff members. They kept the drinks filled and cleared away finished plates. Everyone was friendly and made for a great service experience.\n\nTo finish it off, we ordered the banana pudding for dessert. No true Southerner can pass up banana pudding when given the choice. I grew up on my grandma's banana pudding, so there was a high bar of expectations set. I was not disappointed. The style was different from that of my grandmothers, but it was still very good. They use crumbled vanilla wafers as both a base and a topping. As with the drinks, it comes out served in a large mason jar. Be warned, it's a big serving, so come hungry or be ready to share.  My wife threw in the towel about a quarter of the way through. Rookie.  I tore through it like a Serengeti Lion devouring its prey.\n\nMy hunger sated and my inner fat kid crying for mercy, I lay down my fork and napkin in victory. I'm fairly certain I ate the equivalent of two days caloric intake. with a smile on my face, I thought dreamily of the Tums sitting on my nightstand at home.","useful":14,"funny":12,"cool":12,"type":"review"}

I can easily say that everything I've ever ordered at LoLo's has been delicious.\n\nThe sweet tea is as advertised.  When ordering the Kool Aid, I usually order it as half water, half Kool Aid as to not slip into a diabetic coma.\n\nThe prices are on par as far as soul food places go.\n\nI do not mind waiting for good food, so I won't score negatively on that.\n\nThe wait staff is pretty attentive as far as the usual wait service goes.\n\nI only have one complaint.  There have been a couple of times when there were a couple of unruly, obnoxiously loud (maybe even ungodly loud) people there while I was dining with my wife and 2 daughters.  They were using expletives and using language that had graphic sexual undertones.  Mind you, this was at a volume that was loud enough for everyone in the restaurant to hear.  The wait staff and management didn't even bother to ask them to simmer down and have some respect for the other patrons.  \n\nI've always had really good dining experiences at LoLo's.  The staff is friendly, other than a couple of incidents, the other patrons are lively and provide a good dining atmosphere.  Other than the two times I mentioned, I thought this was a really good family restaurant.\n\nI really do wish when incidents like this occur, that the wait staff or management steps up and ensures that a couple of people don't ruin the dining experience of everyone in the restaurant.  I am no stranger to eating in a loud restaurant where the level of noise is very high due to everyone having normal conversations.  The two times that I was unfortunate enough to go through this has actually kept me from going back.\n\nThere's no doubt I'll go there again.  I will crave their fried chicken and catfish enough to cross my fingers and give it another try.  It's just too bad that now, I can't trust the restaurant enough to bring my daughters there.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The first time I visited, the resto was so packed, I waited ten minutes and then left.  The second time, debated on leaving, but stayed.  Had fried chicken, a waffle, cornbread, and the candied yams.  Best thing were the yams!  Chicken was alright.  Waffle was too thin, light in color, and soggy.  It didn't help to witness one of the staff sneaking in the back with a bag of Bisquick while I was waiting for a table.  I thought the waffles and batter were homemade??  Cornbread didn't even compare to Redfish or Z'Tejas!  Honestly, it tasted like the dried versions I tried at Big City BBQ and Marie Callender's...

We arrived on a Saturday night about 6 and to our surprise the place wasn't crowded..actually got a parking place right in front. When we walked in a woman yelled sit any where..then someone else yelled..y'all have to wait. so we waited..and waited. Mind you that several tables in plain view were available. After we were seated..without menus, we waited another 10 minutes before someone came back to the table with our menus..we didn't really need the menus for we have been to Lo-Lo's several times. Waited another 15 minutes for someone to take our order..a Betty Boop, a Tre Tre, a plain waffle for the child, 1 sweet tea, 1 unsweeted tea, 1 red kool-aid. Took another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  Again..not busy. The waitress brought out the Tre Tre and Betty Boop but not the waffle for our son..had to wait another 10 minutes to flag someone down to bring his waffle..long story short, the chicken and waffles were amazing as always, but the unsweeted tea was on the verge of souring..and the service was just plain awful. Lo-Lo's gets extremely buzy, especially on Sunday mornings and we have never had a problem, maybe it was an off night..but for the life of me I don't understand why it took us almost 2 hours for 3 pieces of fried chicken and 3 waffles.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I do not like grits so I traded it for fries but they gave me rice instead... (must have been the loudness of the place). The chicken skin is so delicious and crisp with the perfect amount of salt. When you add their hot sauce the flavor is divine. The waffles have cinnamon and are nice and fluffy. I can't say much about the eggs and \"fries\" (rice) because they were pretty standard.

You would think that asking for a to go box would be the queue to bring the check but not for that guy.\nI love the dark meat chicken it was DELICIOUS but the white meat was so dry I chocked on it.

After a super hot day of walking through the Botanical Gardens, the only thing that got me through was thinking about checking out Lo-Lo's and the let me tell you that they didn't disappoint!  The place was packed at 5pm but we luckily got in super fast.  Our table tried a little bit of everything.  The Chicken and Waffles, Fried Catfish, Fried Redfish, Collard Greens, and the Gizzards.  Let me start with my favorite, the fried chicken.  Delicious!!  Perfectly seasoned and crispy.  It's hard to find a place where they put the right seasonings in the fried chicken, but Lo-Lo's got it just right.   A great balance of seasoning to give the chicken some zing and super crispy.  The catfish was great, with a similar seasoning.  Nice big filets and not greasy at all, same goes for the redfish.  The redfish was like a southern version of fish and chips.  I'm not a fan of gizzards, but Lo-Lo's got it right so that they were tender instead of rubbery and how can it fail smothered with gravy?  Let's also not forget the waffle, damn that thing was good, with some cinnamon or something in the batter so that it was just a good without the syrup.  \n\nI'm also an unsweetened tea kind of girl now, but Lo-Lo's brought back memories with their sweetened tea in big mason jars, just perfect.\n\nThe service was great as well.  Enjoy the ambiance b\/c it was authentic and the people that waited on us were awesome.\n\nI'll be making Lo-Lo's a permanent stop on all my trips back to Phoenix!!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

For dessert, if you like banana pudding, definitely give it a try. It tastes great and has a good ratio of bananas to cookies. On top of that, it's served in a mason jar! \n\nService here is great.

They even had a water cooler with cold water for us to enjoy while we waited, so that we would not swoon from heat exhaustion.\n\nThe food was tasty, that's for sure. I ordered one piece of chicken breast and one waffle. Both items were DELICIOUS! Thank goodness Lo-Lo's knows how to make their namesake dishes, and make them well!

Forreally for real though... Ugh.... *Insert Homer Simpson-esque gargling sound here!* \n\nMy cousin and I were spent the weekend being hermits and I got tired of it and offered her some LoLo's, never one to turn down a free meal, she happily said yes. We brought my mom along and were Lo-Lo's bound.\n\nWhen we got there I saw the lil tent and mini bar of doom. I've read the many reviews warning me about Lo-Lo's 40+ minute wait... but seeing no one standing in the way of the misting fan, we decided to trudge on in... and we were SO lucky to find more empty tables than filled. We sat down in the nice cool mustered colored room, lined with Framed pictures depitcing the Jazz Era... \n\nWe were quickly brought menus and we ordered a round of tea... I had the Half sweet & Half unsweetened tea... my cousin chose the sweetened tea and my mom the chose the unsweetened tea. When the HUGE mason jars hit the table they were excited! I held my own taste test and concluded that Yelpers are always right and that the half & half rules. \n\nOur waitress was nice enough to explain some of the dishes to us. We ordered and waited a lil while... not as long as I did the first time I went. While we waited and talked the rest of the tables around us quickly filled and we considered ourself fortunate to have arrived when we did. I told them of the warnings about going to Lo-Lo's after church on Sunday... Expect an hour long wait! They whistled and said that it couldn't be that good... \n\nand then the food arrived...\n\nIt was better than I remember it! i chose the Soul-food platter which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken and your choice of two sides... I chose a waffle and smothered potatos and a large muffin type hunk of cornbread. My mom ordered the same thing but chose potato salad & yams as her sides. My cousin got a pair of drumsticks with a waffle. \n\nWe were all silent for a good five minutes. When we finally went up for air. My mom couldn't believe how good her yams were. She looked like she wanted to cry! lol... and she said the potato salad was great and that the chicken was EXACTLY what she wanted!!  My cousin was inlove with the chrunchy-type crispness salty sweetness of the chicken & Waffle combination. and I, I was about to DRINK my smothered potatos, which are nothing but simply boiled potatos swimming in this basil-thyme(?) flavored chicken gravy that was sent here from heaven!! IT was the BEST gravy I EVER EVER tasted!! I was happily taking a bite of chicken with a bite of waffle and then followed it with a nice perfect smothered chunk of potato... when... when... it was GONE!! ARGGHHH!! When are they going to invent never empty bowls?!?! huh?! WHEN?!\n\nThere was nothing but small micro bits of potato swimming in the most amazing grazy... and all I had was a fork... but there... was still some left... and not a spoon in sight, but I could pick up the lil mini bowl.... \n\n\"DON'T EVEN think about it!\" My mom scolded me while reading my thoughts\n\nDANG! \n\nI reached a happy medium when I got smart and skewerd a nice piece of chicken and dunked it in the gravy and I was SO back in business!! :D whoo hoo!! It was heaven. pure heaven. \n\nI know very few things about heaven... I know O'odham Cumbia in Heaven... and I know Lo-Lo's gravy is poured from FOUNTAINS in heaven!! haha.... \n\nMeanwhile - back on Earth, we devoured our food. I honestly thought I was going to have tons leftover for my lunch the next day... my mom thought the same... no such luck for any of us! My mom was in extacy over her yams that she asked for their recipe... the waitress said she'd ask and quickly came back with: brown sugar, cinnamon & vanilla - boiled and NOT baked... and that's it. And PLEASE let me tell ya'll - she has NEVER ever done that with me before... this woman doesn't like ANYTHING\/BODY... and that day, she fell in love with those yams! (Where's my calender?!)\n\nWe were laughing and talking about how good the lemonade is (oh yeah - when I needed a refil, I just asked for some lemonade instead of more tea, she did it no problem... she also did the same for my cousin who tried the red kool-aid) and how great the food was when I got a call from a good friend of mine. I told him where I was when he made fun of me and told me to clog my artaries... I made a face and asked him in a rather rude tone if he's ever been to Lo-Lo's, he said no. And then I told him... he'll never get how little I care about my artieries when I'm here until he tries it for himself! Only until you try it do you get how amazing it is...\n\nSo simple, so devine.

I traveled from south east phoenix to central and Buckeye road location. When i arrived I had to tables ahead of me. I explained that I would like to place a to go order. The hostess proceeded with the customer ahead of me- which was not an issue. After waiting about 15 mins and 5 customers later i asked the hostess when someone would be able to take my order as I was on lunch, she told me that she had to find someone to take my order. I waited another 10 mins, So now I was 45min into my 1 hour lunch and not even an order placed. Needless to say. I left hungry and upset(don't play with my food). They didn't even notice. I called and place a complaint with the manager Mills. I explained everything to him and he gave me his personal cell phone number and told me to call him and he would make sure I was taken care of and that my next order would be on the house. About 2-3 week later I called and tried to place an order. When I spoke to Mills he made several bad management decision 1. He didn't handle my order personally he told me to call the main number and place an order. When I called the told me that they are only taking payment over the phone for call in orders, I explained to them that Mills told me to call and he would be taking care of my order, they said they had to verify this. 2.Mills then got on the phone and began to question me like I had made the whole thing up.  Stating did He tell me that he would take care of my order? Or are those my words? I explained the initial situation and 3. he said he remembers me but doesn't remember stating  the order would be on the house. He seemed hesitant and said well what would you like to order? I replied nothing and hung up. HORRIBLE customer service. I only wanted a Tre-Tre which was $7 (and nothing for me to pay). What a way to lose a customer. I was not out to get over or just cop a free meal. I wanted to know I was valued as a customer, and repayment for my time and gas I spent driving half way across town the last time I visited their establishment. I know that my order would not break LoLo's but their horrible customer service will. Because if this is how the do business I know there will be other customers who will not be returning to LoLo's.

We had been back-and-forth yelping, and Lo-Lo's was something we knew we definitely had to try.... but we had no idea how to get there from ASU in Tempe. After trying for half an hour to use the Valley Metro Trip Planner (which gets a NEGATIVE 4 stars for being completely unintuitive and impossible!), we called Lo-Lo's and were immediately giving light rail and bus directions. \n\nAfter probably an hour and a half, during which we are getting hungrier and hungrier, and all our conversation is redirecting to fried chicken, we walk in the door and are immediately welcomed and told to sit whereever we like. We grab a table, and are offered drinks. I got a re-fillable jar of some of the best sweet tea I've ever had (although walking three blocks in 100 degree weather may have biased that opinion sometime), and we also got two ice waters to rehydrate. We looked at the menu and immediately knew what we wanted. I ordered the soul food platter, 3 pieces of fried chicken, cornbread, and sides of mac n'cheese and collard greens. Daniel ordered the Lil' Amadi, which was 1 leg and 1 thigh with a waffle, and a side of red beans (no rice). \n\nOkay. So. I don't like waffles. I'm used the Belgian waffles, which are way too huge and fill me up with bread taste and make me feel bloated. Lo-Lo's waffle blew me away; it literally was like buttery, slightly mealy, air. I kept stealing bites until I basically ate the whole thing, drenched in maple syrup and fluffy whipped butter. The red beans and collard greens were incredible! We both agreed that they were our favorites of the whole meal (two former vegans... haha): the beans had a touch of sweetness, simultaneously savory and tender. The collards had basically no bitterness at all, but weren't super salty. They were tender and cut into small slices that perfectly combined into a side-appropritate mouthfull. The mac n'cheese was pretty good but I didn't really focus on its taste. The chicken! Oh my god. I've never had breast meat that was still juicy. Incredible texture, the tenderness of the meat and the crispness of the skin juxtaposed. This place definitely blows Roscoe's out, and as a native LA-er, I'm sorry to say it. \n\nThe price is really great, less than 30 altogether, and we left a large tip because the service was so great! We felt so welcomed by the staff, and we could tell that they were having a chill time as well, singing along to Justin Timberlake in the next room. The only downside (not on their end) was that because of my slight cold, I couldn't taste all the flavors as well as I could have otherwise; that's the only reason this isn't getting a 5, and I can see myself changing that... I also cursed myself for forgetting my camera. I guess that means that I'll have to make another trip out there before I'm out of this desert.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Well I've traveled all over and eaten a lot of different places and my wife is southern born and raised.  \n\nThe building is a combo of hipster meets southern.  They have nice outdoor seating and the decor was great.  Loved the music they played (uncensored) had that IDGAF vibe.  \n\nDown to the nitty gritty......the food!  First off we were told upon walking in that their chicken delivery truck was in a wreck and they were running dangerously low on all chicken but wings.  It was great for them to let us know off the bat but sad to think of all that could have been with that chicken.  We tried a couple drinks and had the two two (two waffles and two chicken wings) and the D man (waffle and fried catfish).  Everything was superb.  Waffles were done great, the syrup they use was excellent and the chicken, although small, was finger licking!  The drinks were made fast and fresh and came out in ball jars.  \n\nIf you're in Phoenix and anywhere near one of these restaurants go.  Just go.  You won't be disappointed.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I told her that I wanted the original order I had placed. Well they brought everything out for the table. I was the only one stuck watching other people eat. This kinda sucked because I was starving! They had served me the sides that come with the order and by the time they were almost gone I finally got my main course. It was the catfish served plain on a plate! There was no seasoning, the batter was tasteless, and I must say the food overall was pretty damn weak! \n\nThe drinks we ordered were Kool-Aid thinking how cool would it be to get something that harkens back to childhood. Strangely this stuff burned my tongue because it wasn't mixed right. So I asked for a Bloody mary. The bloody mary came to me in what looked like an 8oz serving for a whopping $8.50!!!! This is ridiculous, its pre made mix with a piece of bacon in it! Nothing Special! \nAll in all this sucks as we only went here because when polled online, a lot of people said that we should go here! All in all the service sucked, and the food was super sub par. The catfish was served battered with no condiments, not even lemon wedges to squeeze onto it to make it taste better! Needless to say I took the stuff home and dressed it like it shoulda been and it was good. So if you are in the market to buy expensive catfish to take home and \" Recook\" then this is a good bet, but most want the experience as is! In this case good luck!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We went for my birthday breakfast around 11 and ordered Betty's Boob and Malaysia's Focheezy Juicy Hood Burger to kind of get a broader taste of the food. It was good, great even, but not perfect. For one, the chicken was a little dry and slightly chewy. Still edible and the seasoning was superb, but I wish the piece had been nice and juicy on the inside. The waffle was delicious. Wanted a little cruch on the outside there, but have no complaints about the taste at all. Together the chicken and waffles we very good. Then there was the burger which, same as the chicken and waffles, was very good all together, but the patty was more well than I ordered and needed some more seasoning. It was however a decently thick patty,  juicy and cheezy as the name states with lots of veggies and a tasty bun. \n\nWould return again, but like I said, at a hopefully less busy day\/time.

But I've never been much of a meat eater so I didn't eat if off the bone and have never thought to order it before. But coming to Phoenix this time my husband was craving his favorite lunch. He hadn't been here since the restaurant operated in the little house out back and he was a bit apprehensive that the food wouldn't be as good. He's was very happy that it was as delicious as he remembered. \nThe new restaurant is adorable. Very quaint with the rustic touches and decor but modern at the same time since it's relatively newly remodeled. \nTrace got his traditional chicken and waffles. And I got the boneless version. The chicken was succulent with a tasty crispy fried crust, not greasy. The waffle was delicious with butter and a great syrup which soaked in. Portion size was generous with a good price. I had to use skill to eat it all, because my mouth most definitely wanted to. And who can forget the sweet tea, served in a mason jar.

We drank sweet tea out of Mason jars. The menu had items named after characters from Spike Lee films. There was a \"Toy Toy\" and a \"Betty Boop\" in 'Crooklyn' right? I could swear there was a Sha Nay Nay in there somewhere.\n\nI was told I had ordered fried chicken smothered in mashed potatoes and gravy. Yes. Smothered. As in \"served as one entity\". According to Misty S, I tried fruitlessly to eat the aforementioned mad creation with a fork and knife, to try and give our lunch companion Erica O the impression that I was not, in fact, a gluttonous fatty without dignity, as my mashed potato-flavored chicken was trying to suggest.\n\nI had mentioned, before passing out in the car, that I found the waffles to be fluffy bundles of cinnamon joy. And that they tasted just fine without syrup, which was good, because I ended up getting most of my syrup on the damned fried chicki-mashed potatoes.\n\nThey had offered us dessert afterwards, which doesn't make any sense to me. If I had just eaten two syrup-less waffles and fried chicken soaked in mashed potatoes and covered in mis-aimed maple syrup, the last thing I'd expect is to be offered red velvet cake. But I'm sure at the time the idea seemed much more reasonable.\n\nThe food couldn't have been that bad, for though it gave me a \"food coma\" as the natives call it, I didn't suffer any intestinal woes.\n\nThe story sounded so fantastic and sensational I almost didn't believe. Surely I would've remembered dining in such a wonderland of soul food stereotypes. I was tempted to call Erica O and cross-reference Misty S' account with one of her own, but we were in the parking lot of Arrowhead mall and I needed a new pair of shoes.

A lot of my friends mothers would cook great soul food and this reminds me of when I was a kid. \nToday was my second visit to this place. It was as good or better than the first time a few months ago. This time I have the \"Betty Boop\", a single waffle, with a huge chicken breast, with a side of bacon and a side of fried Okra. I was full half way through but kept eating because it was all sooo good!!! If your on a diet this can't be the best place to go, but if your skipping a day on your diet, or just don't care, then get over to this place for great food.

Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles is one of them.\n\nMost people I know are familiar with this valley original. Just in case you know the name, but have yet to sample the southern\/soul-food offerings, try this simple test. Drive to the nearest Lo-Lo's and stand in the parking lot. It's gotta be the most intoxicating aroma around any restaurant! I had no idea how good sweet maple and savory fried chicken smelled together until my first visit to the original Lo-Lo's on Central.\n\nI'm lucky that my lunch time co-horts have an adventurous attitude toward eating. Either that or we're all closet foodies. Regardless, we ended up just south of downtown today and I was in the mood for breakfast. I've tried the chicken and waffles on previous visits. Today was an opportunity to enjoy the biscuits and gravy.\n\nWe arrived before noon because this place can fill up fast. We were seated right away and our server Alexis was awesome. The food arrived quickly and everything was piping hot. The fried potatoes were obviously cooked to order and the biscuits were fluffy and covered with a delicious sausage gravy. Probably the best version of this dish I've ever enjoyed. And my co-workers each enjoyed the Betty Boob (chicken breast and a waffle).\n\nGood food, great service, friendly staff, nice decor...

Don't let the surrounding area fool you though, inside this small Soul food joint you will find some delicious eats. The inside of Lolo's has a very homey look and feel. Their menu is full of different Soul food fare. The coolest thing about Lolo's is that their entire menu is offered all day. If you want breakfast for dinner, you can. If you want dinner for breakfast, go for it. It's awesome!\n \nMy fiancé and I both ordered their KK's breakfast, which consisted of three pieces of fried chicken, two waffles (we both added pecans to our waffles), cheese grits and scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and onions. We also got a side of Mac and cheese, Yams, sausage patties and a slice of red velvet cake. My father ordered their fired chicken omelet, which was made with fried chicken, bell peppers, onions and cheese. Everything that we ate that morning was excellent. The fried chicken was really juicy and flavorful, especially the dark meat. The waffles were light and fluffy and packed full of pecans. The yams were really sweet and had a nice cinnamony flavor. Their sausage patties, which they make in house, were some of the best I have ever had. The Mac and cheese was really cheesy and gooey. The grits were also really cheesy and also really buttery. My dad's omelet was delicious. They made his omelet with four eggs and loaded it with juicy fried chicken (skin and all) and lots of grilled veggies. They also topped it with a ton of shredded cheese. The red velvet cake, which we took to go, was really moist. The cream cheese frosting, which was covered with pecans, was not overly sweet and was really creamy. To wash down all this yummy grub I had a huge glass of super sweet cherry Kool-Aid. My fiancé and dad both had their sweet tea, which was just as sweet as their Kool-Aid.\n \nThe service here was great. Our waitress was really funny and friendly. She was shocked to see us order so much food, especially at 10am. She joked around with us the whole time and always kept my mason jar of Kool-Aid filled to the brim. The prices here were great too.\n \nIf you like Soul Food and happen to be in the Phoenix area then you have to check out Lolo's. This place rocks!","useful":18,"funny":16,"cool":17,"type":"review"}

We walk to the back (chick'n coop) only to be told our table was not ready. So I sat down in the chair just outside the chick'n coop door only be to be told by the rude hostess (a Hispanic lady) that I could not sit and wait there I needed to go sit down in the front.

My husband had gone to the bathroom and I told the rude hostess I would wait for my husband to walk out of the bathroom before being seated so we could sit down in the chick'n coop together.

Steve came & refilled my husbands drink I still had some in my cup but by the time I was done Steve never came back another random gentlemen I think he was also a busser because I had seen him sweeping & cleaning off a table earlier. Offered to get me a refill, we revived our check & to go cups and left. The service was not very helpful or friendly in my eyes. The food was amazing I would only choose to go back for  he food.

Then 15 minutes - not a single staff member appeared.  We were being totally ignored.  I started checking Yelp for nearby restaurants and planning our escape from what looked to be an impending \"major fail.\"  Then suddenly our waiter appeared and was apologetic.  We were nice in return.  He blamed his slowness on a nearby table that was \"being difficult\" (tacky) and took our drink orders.  Another 10 minutes goes by.  Then 15.  Finally he shows up with our drinks and says nothing - just throws them down.  Weird.  He was having a bad night and we were paying the price.  Before he has another chance to run off, I politely tell him we'd like to get our order in.  He takes our order and runs off again saying very little.  25 minutes pass before he brings out the appetizer.  Then another 20 minutes later our entrees appear.  The whole time he's being as scarce as he possibly can and saying as little as possible every time he appears. Finally whilst eating our food another member of the staff (Susan) drops by and is quite helpful.  She refills our drinks and takes the long-devoured appetizer plate away.  She stops by several times to ask if we need anything.  Good job, Susan!  Unfortunately she turns our table back over to our original waiter who (after another unreasonably long wait) ended up bringing out the check.  He had nothing else to say.  Pretty astounding service for a restaurant that charges $20+\/plate (and - based on the mandatory Valet parking - would like to charge more).

The first occasion I ordered to go, I ordered ahead of time to make sure that it would be ready they said it would be ready around 12:20pm i got there at 12:10pm the food was already bagged up and sitting there cold the waffle cold and like rubber they might I add they forgot my cornbread and my waffle I had to go out to my car and look in the bag to notice they weren't in the bag after paying my $17.00 for it. I got to work I was on my lunch break and called to reach out to their manager who asks me to come back but I told him I only had a 30 min lunch and couldnt return until after 6pm and he said thats fine but wanted the food. I couldnt come by after work as I had to pick up my kids from daycare on the other side of town then he ignore my attempts to reach out to him until today 12\/6\/2015 I called him and he said he would not replace my food as they get calls like mine all the time and that he'd do something nice for us but not replace the food I said thats fine I'm coming in with my wife Ill see you in a minute. We get there are seated at 5:35pm we explain that I'd like to see the manager the waitress then says ok I will get him, she asks us what we want to drink we order a water and a sweet tea and we wait 15 mins for our drinks ready to order we see her help everyone else and even brings us napkins after 15 mins! and doesnt ask us for our order or even bring us our drinks! We had to ask a nice young man by the name of Jacquan who immediately helped us pt in our order, then the waitress suddenly shows up with our drinks and seems upset she says I talked to the manager and he just said he'd give you a dessert, so instead of confronting and greeting his guest he hides behind his staff and doesn't even come out and speak to us. Then the waitress who is now upset doesnt speak to us for the rest of the night. Meanwhile we wait and see everyone else already eating a person who was seated just before us already eating and almost done it is now 6:45pm and we have not even received our appetizer we ordered nor our food everyone is now leaving as they were closing at this time cleaning and putting up chairs around us. We finally receive our food and my plattter which includes cornbread, doesnt have cornbread they tell me that they are out of cornbread, wow so I come here already have a bad previous experience my food isnt replaced and to top it off they are out of the food I ordered. They then bring my wifes food which is a chili bowl and its frozen cold and has cold non melted cheese on top as if it had been sitting in the window until our chicken was done then they just threw some cheese on it, ridiculous.... To make things worst theres now only three people in the resteraunt they are paying their bills and we barely receiving our food now feel rushed as the entire staff keeps looking at us basicaly wanting to leave so we did'nt even get to enjoy our meal we just paid $30.00 for that was cold my wife didnt even eat because she didnt want to put in another order and make everyone wait for us as we already waiting an hour for cold food and no cornbread....

It was tough finding a parking spot, and we had to eventually park across the street. Not knowing if you car is going to get towed kinda made me rush through my meal.

However, our visit was good but not the 5 star experience we had hoped for.\n\nThe decor and theme inside is catchy and looks like what you would expect a great chicken and waffle joint to look like. The mason jar glasses and chicken theme along with the specialty Kool-Aide flavors is neat. Everything was neat and clean inside and the staff was friendly and pleasant. \n\nLong Wait and Slow Service\n\nThe wait on Sunday was 45 minutes for a table for two which is not that uncommon for a great food place on the weekend. However, it's still a 45 minute wait once we were seated we then figured out why the wait was so long. It was not the busy number of customers its the EXTREMELY slow service.\n\nWe placed an appetizer order and that took about 35 minutes for the catfish beignets. When they did arrive they were tasty and we enjoyed them. We placed our order not long after the app order and that took about another 45 minutes after the app. So all in all about an hour for our food to be delivered. We noticed many of the other tables were taking 45 min to an hour as well for their food. \n\nWhen a kitchen is making food fresh I know it can take longer to get out to the customer and is well worth it usually. However, an hour to serve chicken and waffles even fresh is excessive. If the kitchen could expedite faster they could reduce the wait times and turn the tables more quickly improving the customer experience. \n\nFood\n\nWe both ordered chicken and waffle dishes I added on scrambled eggs and my wife selected grits. The chicken was tasty and juicy with a nice crispy skin. The waffle was regular waffles you would get in a hotel thin, bland, and not crispy. The eggs I ordered they messed up the order and needed to replace them. I was impressed how quickly they took care of it and remade the eggs. The grits were cooked perfect and my wife enjoyed them with the cheese and butter. \n\nOverall I can see the draw people have with the location. The owner has done a great job of branding the business, creating excitement inside with the decor, and his staff is friendly. The only downside is the long wait to get inside, long wait for the food, and mixed up order. The actual chicken and waffles were good and very similar to other places I have visited around the country. \n\nThey are worth visiting and it is a good experience. If you visit on a non-weekend it might less of a wait as well. I hope you have the 5 star experience we hoped to have and others here on yelp have experienced.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Once you step out of your car the smell of waffles wafting in the air will resolve some of that stress- trust.\n\nI'm going to say what I tell everyone about having chicken & waffles ... it is one glorious meal, then you feel like garbage afterwards- but it's totally worth it! Speaking of which, chicken and waffles sound really good about now.\n\nO:^)","useful":12,"funny":12,"cool":12,"type":"review"}

They took the time to help us find a way to the restaurant using public transportation(we were coming from ASU so we had to use both the light rail and bus system) when the trip planner had failed us miserably and would otherwise have left us stranded in 100 degree weather. \n\nThe space is very cozy and the table and chairs are very much something laypeople could own(wood - painted, none of that hyper-modern furniture here). It's not a super big restaurant so I imagine they could get packed very easily during peak business hours. \n\nThe food here is absolutely amazing. I got to try a few dishes:\n\n1. Lil' Amadi(waffle plus leg and thigh of chicken) - This is the best fried chicken I've ever had. The skin was not soggy at all and had a very nice crisp\/crunch to eat. The skin was not rubbery at all and gave away easily with a little resistance(which is nice, because super flaky skin is never good and a teeny bit of resistance keeps the skin together on the chicken). The skin to meat ratio was also good - in other words, I didn't feel like I was either eating nothing but skin or that they were being skimpy with the skin. The meat was extremely juicy and my girlfriend let me try some of her white meat and it is one of the few times(other than in Pho) that I've had white meat that is juicy. The waffle was also one of the best waffles I've ever had and I usually hate waffles. The waffle here was on the thinner side and had great texture. It was slightly crispy on the outside while maintaining a very moist inside - great texture combination. Also, the waffle wasn't soggy. This is key because I usually hate Belgian waffles because they're too thick, cakey, and tend to get soggy in the middle and are just plain gross. They give you a healthy dose of butter and syrup which made eating the chicken and waffles much more enjoyable.\n\nSoul Food Platter - My girlfriend and I basically ordered two dishes and tried eachother's dishes. The soul food platter allows you to choose between chicken or fish and a choice of two side dishes and corn bread. My girlfriend got chicken(three-ish pieces - sometimes I don't consider the chicken wing a full piece because of the higher bone to meat ratio than other parts of the chicken), collard greens, and mac-n-cheese. The collard greens were delicious! They weren't too salty like some of the other times I've tried them. They were also cooked just right - not too soft due to overcooking but not too hard due to undercooking. The leaves were soft and the stalk gave more solid texture to juxtapose with the leaves(but not saying that the stalk was hard - it wasn't - just more firm than the leaves). The mac-n-cheese was okay. I've definitely had better. To me, it was a slightly more gourmet version of the Kraft's mac-n-cheese. The corn bread was also just okay. It was on the more dry side and I ended up having to dip the corn bread in sauce because my salivary glands were running low on lubricant. \n\nRed Beans - These were delicious! My girlfriend thinks they cooked them with ham to give it a slightly smokey, salty taste and I think I agree. They're not too sweet which I definitely find to be a characteristic of cheap red beans. Lo-Lo's makes an effort to actually make their red beans savory and it's very evident. The sauce goes great with the cornbread as extra lubricant. \n\nIn regards to side dishes I recommend getting the collard greens and red beans. \n\nSweet Tea - My girlfriend says that iced tea is usually lackluster because it's just like drinking tea - except cold and that the defining factor to sweet tea is that it's sweet and refreshing - something cold drinks should be. I agree. The sweet tea here was divine and a perfect beverage to our meal and great to have when the weather outside was 100 degrees. Another big plus is that there were unlimited refills! It's served in a huge jar and we easily went through two of them. Amazing. \n\nOne regret I have is not trying the red velvet cake. \n\nThe food here is decently priced. It came out to roughly $27 for the both of us and we left extremely full and happy. \n\nThe reason why I hesitate giving Lo-Lo's five stars is because I'm not a veteran chicken and waffles eater, but rather, a recently deflowered chicken and waffles novice. Until I've had more chicken and waffles to compare to, I will hold off the five stars and just give four stars for now. \n\nI definitely recommend this place to anyone in town!","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

There is something uniquely cinnamonny in the syrup that makes the perfect topper to their waffle; the chicken is deep fried, the grits waiting to swim in butter, the lemonade cool and sweet on a hot Phoenix day. Your doctor may not like you going here, but your stomach certainly will.\n\nFind an odd hour to go; Sunday mornings are always particularly packed with the post-church crowd and it's harder than usual to find a seat. Chicken and waffles are good any time of the day.\n\nAnd a last note - get a t-shirt, wear it around and see just how unusual the idea of chicken and waffles is to the non soul food loving masses.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

I love the chicken and since my last review I have been back for to go orders several times. The service is fast and very friendly. I have since tried several different side Items, almost all of them I think.\n\nMy top sides are;\n\nButtered Corn outstanding 5 stars\nGreens best I have had outside the house solid 5 stars\nMac and Cheese between a 4 and 5 just because some days it's on point and others it's just aight. \nSmothered potatoes 4 stars\nCandied yams 4 stars\nRice and gravy 2 stars the gravy was disappointing had bell pepper in it.\nMy least favorite Red beans and rice 1 star, I love red beans and rice but not with BBQ sauce yuck. \n\nI had a little problem with the desert. I love Red velvet cake but theirs is disappointing. I went on Saturday and saw that delicious mountain of a cake in the window and knew I had to have a slice. I got it home it tasted like cornbread?! WTF Someone messed up and made it wrong. I called they offered me another the next day but that one wasn't much better. The sock it to me cake was very sweet. \n\nMy standing order will be Chicken, mac n cheese and greens from now on! I have yet to try a waffle since I have been getting to go orders I don't know how well a waffle will travel. I like the initial crispness to my waffles.

We came in and were told the wait would be 20 minutes, so that's fine, we stood close to the host stand because there was no seating in the waiting area open. Once people got up from there the manager at the front rudely told us to pretty much move because we were in the way. We ignored the attitude and were seated shortly anyways. Our server took our drink orders and food orders so all good there.. Fast forward an hour and a half later, we still had not received our food. Keep in mind the place was semi full. So we finally said something to a man who appeared to be a manager and he offered to go check on our food. He came back 5 minutes later with our food. Now I've been a server so I could tell this food had been sitting at the window for a good while and I believe the manager said something to the server about it. Unfortunately at this point we had no time to eat the food since 2 friends I was with had to leave for their flight already so we asked for boxes and the check (both were promptly given of course). No one apologized for the wait or offered to at least comp drinks or my friends salad that had cold chicken and the wrong dressing all over it. Pretty disappointed considering I've always had a great experience here.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We headed in and were greeted right away. We didn't have a reservation, but we lucked out and got there earlier than the rush, so we were seated in a nice booth up front.  The place filled up pretty quickly after we arrived, so I would recommend calling ahead if you have a larger party (and they only seat your party once everyone has arrived, so keep that in mind, too).\n\nOur waitress was Leslie and she was wonderful from the very start.  Friendly and accommodating she allowed us a bit of time to look over the menu and made recommendations based on our preferences, which worked out nicely.  I had the Lo-Lo's meal and he had the Double D meal, we shared an order of cornbread, cause...who turns down southern style cornbread?? We opted to try out a couple of their drinks which I cannot remember the names of, but they were good! \n\nThe meals came out quickly an were exactly the way we ordered them and they smelled amazing. Chicken was cooked nicely and the breading was really well seasoned. Waffles were fluffy and perfect. The cornbread was gone within seconds of hitting the table. \n\nDespite being way too full for it, we shared a banana pudding for a dessert, which was worth every agonizingly over full bite! I highly recommend this if you from the south and like a good banana pudding with real slices of banana and wafer topping!\n\nOverall: A+\nGreat service, great southern food with hilarious names (amazing dessert for a bonus), and fun ambiance make this place a \"will absolutely return\" venue!","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

We found a fun looking place making a big success of the chicken and waffles concept. We thought it should be a light business that time of the week but soon discovered our mistake. This location seems to always be busy. By the time we were seated, received our food, paid our tab, and left it was 6:45 and the place was nearly empty.\nIn fairness there were nine in our party and a group like that doesn't just fit anywhere but it's still disheartening to watch people arrive an hour after you and get seated immediately. \nFood from the kitchen also was slow to arrive but, {and here is where the good news starts} it was very good!\nWe started with three appetizers, spicy corn fritters, fried green tomatoes, and fried green beans. I felt the beans were kind of bland but the corn fritters were tasty with the right amount of heat and the tomatoes were excellent.\nI had decided on a beet and after ordering 3 different kinds with all being unavailable I settled for a glass of ice water. My co-diners raved about the sweet tea and kool aid drinks.\nMost of my party ordered a variable of the signature chicken and waffles which we all enjoyed. My chicken tenders and waffle were very good. I like the breading and size of the tenders and the waffle was very tasty with a mound of soft sweet butter and a good syrup.\nI would recommend Lo Lo's and would give it 5 stars if the service {which was good} wasn't so slow and parking were less of a problem.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Free but of course you gotta tip the guy. The chicken tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a bit or just wasn't made corrently. The homemade hot sauce is amazing. Like most down home fried chicken places they're a little expensive. We put in a order for the three of us to go and is was almost $50. Just standard 3 pc meals, not their most expensive plate options.

It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! \nThat's about where the love ends with this review sadly. \n\nWe were waiting for one other friend to arrive, they would not seat us until he was there, I have never had this issue at Lolo's. But wait we did. \n\nWhen we were finally seated the waitress took our food and drink order. 10 minutes goes by, no drinks. She comes to our table and says they are our of glasses and we have to wait for clean ones. We asked her if she could just put them in to-go cups, we didn't need the mason jars, she says sure. 10 more minutes go by. Finally out come our drinks, in mason jars. OI. \n\nNext up is the wait for the food. We literally waited an HOUR AND A HALF for our food to come to the table, and I believe the only reason why we got it then was because we had complained to the manager. The table that was seated 10 minutes after us, got fed up and left at about the hour 15 mark and walked out. A table next to us who had received their bill sat and waited a solid 20 minutes just to pay the dang thing! Our waitress completely ignored our table and section the whole time we waited. There were not even drink refills in that 1.5 hour wait. NOTHING. I got up and found a waitress and pointed out our table at the hour mark and asked how long the food wait was, she said 40 minutes, when I told her we were already well passed that she said she would find out what was going on. Nothing. Then our waitress walks by our section at the hour 15 mark we ask her what the hell is going on, we get no real response. FINALLY we are at 1.5 hours and we are ready to walk, our friend goes and finds the manager and asks him whats going on and to please come talk to us. 2 minutes later the manager comes to our table with food! Yesssssss only its wrong, BOO :( They delivered 2 orders of stupid fries to the table, when we told him we only ordered one he said well we are just going to throw this away so keep it, which I am glad we did because it was going to still be a while for all the food to come out correctly. My friends order was the veggie plate, 2 of the 4 sides were wrong, then they tried to deliver the same wrong veggie plate again. She finally gets all of her food. meanwhile myself and a friend are STILL waiting for ours. Then he gets his and the manager says so that's it right??? Ummmm no...how about bringing the pregnant lady her food, eh? \nMy food finally materializes and I am happy. The tell me that they are out of french fries but that they just cut up some potato's and made some fries, fine by me. My friend ordered the catfish and specifically asked the waitress for malt vinegar, she brings him out a cup of white vinegar....who does that? \n\nIve been to both locations plenty of times and have never had this type of experience. It was seriously the worst....and to top that all off when our bill came there wasn't one bit of a discount on it, after all of that, everything we had been through, nothing. we were pretty disappointed in how the staff handled themselves.

He told me \"you should have called me from the parking lot, I would have saved you a bunch of time and aggravation.\" \n\nThis is definitely one of those cases in which you should NEVER believe the hype.  \n\nOver priced. $3 for KOOL AID! (Anybody that orders Kool aid for $3... I have some real estate I want to discuss with you) $16 for dry flavorless chicken and cinnamon waffles. Gimme a break. I can get an entire family meal of chicken at KFC for less than that! And the KFC actually is juicy and has flavor!\n\nThe fried chicken is flavorless. Seriously. Its like flour and a dash of salt. Thats it. NO seasonings at all. They talk about passing down recipes for generations and generation...? WHaaaaaa?  I wonder if while the recipe was being passed down, they deleted the spices to save money on the overpriced food they are selling to us bamboozled people out there... It honestly tastes like fried chicken from a Lubys cafeteria thats specifically cooked to cater to the older folks on restricted diets. \n\nThe waffles were yummy. I will give em that. Cornbread was dry. \n\nIt took over 30 minutes to get a burger. The rest of the meal came out in parts. They forgot some of it altogether till we asked for it. \n\nThis place sucks. Seriously. Its much to do about NOTHING. \n\nI recommend a name change. Lo-Lo's Hi-Hi. Low low quality and high high prices.","useful":9,"funny":5,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Can't forget the mac & cheese either, which was a very healthy portion. \n\nThe food is good, but what won me over? Lemonade. Unlike Roscoe's, Lo-Lo's will refill your lemonade.

Second round, (still no chicken and waffles) eggs were much better but grits were underdone and watery.  When the chicken and waffles showed up, the waffles were already cool with no browning at all.  Coffee was terrible.  Wife's plate was just as bad.  Our original waitress never bothered to check on us until she brought the bill.  And to top it all off, the food is way overpriced, and over hyped!!!\nThe one solid was the chicken.  It was lightly battered and perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The scrambled eggs were real, not the fake crap.  I just wish someone in the back new how to cook them properly.

They tried to charge $7 for a little waffle and 2 cold, greasy chicken thighs. Not impressed at all. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the waiter was nice and the place looked cool. \n\nFirst impressions are everything, so they say, and in this instance I would agree. Since moving here over a year ago I have heard people go on and on about Lolo's chicken and waffles, especially when they find out I moved from the south. \"Oh it is the best soul food\", \"They have the best fried chicken I have had anywhere..\" are some of the things people have said. We live in Mesa and there is not a location near us but this morning  we were running errands in Phoenix and drove about 15 minutes out of our way so I could finally try this place that so many people have raved about. The place was decorated nice, it was not too long after they opened and it was not busy, we were seated right away. Took about 10 minutes before we saw a server, our drinks were brought out fairly quick and our order taken. Our food came out pretty quick but what difference does quick service make when the food is cold? The skin on the chicken was not even crisp on the edges, they had obviously been sitting around for a while. I tried a bite anyway, good fried chicken is good hot or cold and this was not good. It had the overwhelming taste of flour and I think the cook forgot to put seasoning on it at all. When the waiter came over to check on us I told him the chicken was cold and I didn't want it, at first he took the plate back and didn't say anything at all, when he brought the check he apologized. I have heard people say how good it is and maybe my experience is isolated but if it really was an uncommon experience then why didn't the waiter seemed surprised when I returned it? Why didn't he offer to get me a fresh plate? Why didn't a manager come over to see what they problem was or to apologize? Maybe they are used to serving sub-standard food, that is the only thing I can think of. This place reminds me of a lot of places that were really good until they got popular, quality of food and service goes down, prices go up and the only reason they stay in business is because they are \"cool\" or trendy. \n\nBottom line - Don't think I will try this place again, there are so many really good restaurants to try in the Phoenix area and when you are going to spend an average of $10+  per person to sit down & eat somewhere, the food should at least be fresh. \n\nOh yeah, one more thing, a glass jar of kool-aid should never cost $3, unless you get to take the jar with you.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

That's exactly how I like it. \nI also asked our server for an order of her favorite side dish, and she brought me a side of collared greens, which were the best I've ever had.

As it turns out, here in AZ, nothing goes better with fried chicken than crispy waffles!\nI have driven by Lo-lo's many times. Having enjoyed chicken and waffles at the famous Roscoe's in LA years ago, I kept meaning to give this a try. The only trouble is unlike years ago, I'm now trying to avoid fried food, as well as wheat so the concept of eating fried bird and fried batter was a conundrum to say the least.\nI decided after 6 months of staunch resistance to let my hair down and give Lo-Lo's a try.\nI went for lunch on a weekday. The place is directly south of downtown, in a fairly sketchy area. Despite the location, it was PACKED! It's always busy. Here's why:\nIt's billed as a soul food place however there were guys in suits and ladies out for lunch and families and singles like myself. Good soul food attracts a diverse crowd. Seems we might solve the worlds problems by having everyone discuss international conflict with a belly full of soul food. \nThe service from the moment I walked in was fast and friendly.  I got a table right away. My Server was a fun and spunky young woman named Jerri. She brought me an ice tea: huge mason jar! Seemed all the beverages are served this way to ensure no one needs endless refills. \nThe menu is colorful and tongue in cheek, with plenty of Ebonics word play. Being 25% black, I managed. Though my Canuck heritage kinda cancels any of that out!\nI opted for the standard 3-piece fried chicken meal with 2 sides. One has the gravy and onions option, but for my first visit I needed to taste the bird as it comes from the fryer! As I don't eat much carbs these days, I chose spicy collards and string beans with red potatoes.  \nThe food is delicious. It's not fancy. It's not trying to be something other than what it is: down home Southern delicious! The fact that most of the chicken and sides are ready to go back in the kitchen, I had my plate hot and in front of me in about 3mins flat!\nI chose to eat the cornbread as the heck with the carbs my black side wanted that bread! I poured out some of Lo-Lo's signature hot sauce, added a bit of honey and it was on like Donkey Kong! I savored every crispy, spicy, delectable bite!\nThe way I eat chicken is pretty simple: If I can chew or crunch it, it's going down the chute: skin, meat, cartilage, wing-tips, you name it, it's gone! I love eating chicken with my wife cuz I get to eat twice once she's done. \"You're not finishing that?!\" I inquire looking at what to me amounts a 2\/3 eaten morsel reaching for it...she has learned to simply look away and block out the chilling sounds of a carnivore devouring its crispy, salty prey.\nOnce I had finally eaten every possible scrap on my plate, Jerri came by and looking at the meager remains on my now barren plate, asked with a wry smile \"You gonna eat the bones too or are you finished?\" I said \"My only regret is that I don't have an extra stomach or I would order round 2!\"\nIf you want a real down home, down south, downtown fried chicken experience with our without waffles, get you DOWN to Lo-Lo's. You'll be back! \nI'm down.","useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Apparently a traditional southern recipe but one I'd not previously encountered I was told that these were best with a splash of Lo-Lo's \"famous\" hot sauce and although I generally prefer to avoid condiments I must say my neighbors were right as the acidity of the sauce really helped to bring out some of the more briny notes from the salmon while breading remained crunchy with minimal grease.\n\nMoving next to my main plate, the $14 Soulfood Platter with Chicken Fried Chicken, a golden waffle, macaroni and cheese, plus a round of cornbread it would be hard to find a gripe with this dish save for, maybe, those who like their mac n' cheese a little over-baked and with a bit of crunch.  Featuing a double dipped and friend boneless, skinless breast alongside a bowl of intense and peppery sausage gravy the chicken here was definitely the star of the show with each bite juicy and full of crunch but largely devoid of any oil whatsoever.  Nicely spiced and with the gravy further gilding the lily I next turned my attention to the waffle, also crisp but intensely buttery with a good amount of 'give' at the center and while pure maple syrup would have been ideal in the end the Mrs. Butterworth's was fine - the sweetness tempered by the chicken, gravy, and macaroni.  Last but not least, the cornbread crowned with a mound of butter was textbook - a little dry, not too sweet, and good both on its own or as a transition between the plate's other components.\n\nMaking short work of the Soulfood plate my primary server, Joseph, stopped by to say \"nice job\" and asking if I had room for dessert I think he was surprised when I said yes - and even more surprised when I ordered two; one for here, one to go, and both eliciting a slow whistle from the gentleman to my left who said to his wife \"that boy can eat\" - and much like the savories what I ate next would be outstanding.\n\nBeginning first with the lesser known of Lo-Lo's signature desserts, a house made banana puddin' served in a hefty mason jar and topped with an airy dollop of whipped cream - at $5 this is probably the steal of the menu as the container must have contained twenty spoonful of the rich parfait.  At times rife with the fructose of banana and at times mellowed by whipped cream or saturated Nilla wafers with plenty of textural nuance added by crumbles and chunks of unsoaked cookie this was precisely my kind of dessert; high end ingredients or not, I love pudding.\n\nRealizing I couldn't (or a least shouldn't) leave Lo-Lo's without trying their oft raved \"Sandy Sand's Red Velvet Cake\" and knowing I could (but shouldn't) have eaten it while I was still seated at 10 Yuma Street I asked for a piece to be boxed up and although it wasn't pretty, the results were just as good as many have suggested - the cake moist, dense, and loaded with cocoa while the cream cheese icing is slick but not too sweet and nicely tempered by the pecans.  Generally one to fancy cupcakes over sliced cakes mostly because I prefer there to be more cooked surface area and thus more 'sponge' I was particularly interested to see the open baking window as I left the restaurant where the team was assembling the cakes from large springform pans thus allowing the layers to each have more exposure and thus explaining the excellent texture.  For my money I'd go with the puddin', but this is one damned fine Red Velvet, and in the context of the experience that is Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles either make a great finale to a great meal in an unexpected but excellent setting.","useful":7,"funny":2,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The fried chicken is good and so are the waffles which why I was satisfied because of those but it's nothing to WOW about.

Stood waiting for 45 minutes and noticed people that came after us being seated so went up and looked at the waiting list and they had skipped us and been seating people after us with parties of 3 and 4 at tables with four chairs and left us waiting for one of the couple tables of only 2 chairs since there was only two of us. I got upset at the gal running the waiting list and she said \"you're next\" then proceeded to sit 4 more parties before us before we were finally seated at a table with 4 chairs since a table for 2 never opened up.\n\nThat was strike one.\n\nNext, with the name \"Chicken and Waffles\" I expected to have some good waffles and figured they would be BIG. I ordered 3 chicken wings and 1 waffle for $10.50 and was very disappointed when this little thin waffle came out with 3 little tiny chicken wings. I get bigger wings when be buy fried chicken at the deli counter of Fry's grocery stores. I thought about ordering another waffle but seen they wanted $4 for just a tiny waffle and said screw that. I walked away still hungry.\n\nThe chicken had good flavor but the waffle was tiny and soggy and a frozen waffle out of box would have been just as impressive as this waffle.\n\nWe were at the place for nearly 2.5 hours and the bill for two of us was right at $30 for lunch and both of us were still hungry when we left. Not worth the price or the wasted time to eat here.

The chicken was super juicy, the skin was crispy and salty and exactly what I was hoping it would be. The mac & cheese was flavorful and very cheesy. The smothered potatoes were great, chunks of potatoes swimming in a very peppery gravy with some peppers and onions.

One man told us he couldnt have a crowd of 80 trying to pay at the same time. He sent us back to our table to have someone come and help us. After that they told us they could only split the bill in two, which meant that none of us got the correct change. \n\nI love the food and relaxed feeling of eating at Lolo's but I will never return with a group larger than 5, since they seem less than capable of attenting to a large party.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The Kool-Aid was indeed large -- maybe even too large -- but very tasty. For dessert, I had the Red Velvet Cake, and that too was very scrumptious. The sponge was moist, and the frosting wasn't overbearing, but just the perfect punctuation to a well-crafted sentence.\n\nNow, I must be honest and say that the reason I am not giving the restaurant 5 stars is because I came back for Brunch the next day -- a Sunday. I was very excited to return, mainly to have the Biscuits and Gravy, and sadly, I was underwhelmed. Not only did it take an exorbitantly long time for the food to arrive, but when it did, it appeared as if it had been sitting under heating lamps for quite some time. Not to mention, the flavor profile was not nearly as intense as my previous meal there. Might I suggest to this establishment to start taking reservations.

I've been to Roscoe's multiple times and wanted to see if it compared. Truthfully I was not impressed with this experience. Came with a party of 6 for Sunday morning brunch. We had an hour wait which surprisingly was a little bit faster then quoted  which was great. I got the chicken breast and waffle and a side of Mac and cheese which Is generally my usual at Roscoe's. The waffle was thin and smelled fresh and yummy. The chicken was in the small side which is fine for me seeing as I still had a whole waffle and Mac and cheese. When I tasted the chicken it was extremely dry. My sister's chicken wasn't as dry as mine, but still I was a little disappointed. With each bite I took I was in need of a beverage to wash it down with. Unfortunately, I got sweet tea and that was hands down the most disgusting sweet tea of my life! The saying \"Would you like some Tea with that Sugar\" comes to mind. I had to dilute it with water and even then I couldn't drink the pure sugar... We get it, you serve over sugared homemade drinks... But seriously, You're better off getting water or soda which both options contain less sugar then their sweet tea or kool-aid. Anyway, When they initially brought out our food they didn't bring out my side, I asked the waiter about the Mac and he apologized and said it would be out right away. A few minutes later he asked if I ever got it and said he would get it himself; in which he did and was super apologetic about it. He was a sweet guy. The Mac and cheese was plain, it tastes doughy to me, almost bland. The waffle was okay, I put light syrup and ate it, I don't have much to rave about for it was just a regular waffle... I still prefer a Waffle House waffle or Roscoe's... \nMy cousin got chicken smothered in gravy, I tasted the gravy and it was pure amazingness! I instantly wished I would have ordered it. The gravy tastes like bell peppers and other spices, very yummy! \nMy other family members ordered the chorizo plate which was a big serving alongside tortillas which everyone tasted and loved.

Pain, they have a small lot but you can park a block away in the neighborhood. The location inside is clean and decorated very nice and authentic looking. I've read other reviews and hears the service sucks, so I guess we got lucky And got some great help. \n\nDo I recommend it? Meh, I would say sure Go it if you want to try it out. Specifically my food was not that good but from everyone else's food I tried it was good, and I personally would come back only to try their other dinner options...  For chicken and waffles I'll stick to my local Roscoe's.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

A little out of control to be honest. If you're staying in downtown Phoenix, then I suggest you do the 30 minute one way walk. \n\nGrits were exactly how they listed them- plain. With a slab of margarine. I prefer butter. And they really were gritty no smoothness. Eggs were fried in margarine as well. So I'd stay away from it next time. \n\nA lot of carbs: waffles were soggy. They need to stand up to the chicken but didn't. Brother ordered the biscuits and they were giant fist sized and smothered in gravy. \n\nChicken with their hot sauce was the best thing there. Definitely would advise to stick with just the chicken unless you're a fan of margarine and\/or massive amounts of carbs. I love the concept of chicken and waffles (live in LA with the famous Roscoe's, which I don't recommend either) but the waffles always seems to disappoint. It's chicken and waffles. Not chicken with pancakes. \n\nParking is plentiful. Also have a bike station around the corner if biking is more your thing than the walk\/drive. \n\nRemember: food adventures are out there.

We all ordered the smothered chicken and man it was DELICIOUS. It definitely hit the spot. The chicken even though it was smothered with the creamy gravy and onions still had a little crunch to it which was good still. I added some hot sauce to it and it just made this plate to die for.\n\nWaffles were hot and fresh. Poured some syrup all over it and I couldn't ask for anything more. Finished off all of the chicken, some of the gravy even made its way onto the waffles, but that didn't even matter because whatever was on that plate was just the right kind of balance of sweet and saltiness together.

We had an emergency stop at Wal-Greens for Lactaid, Tums, Bean-O, and Ginger Ale. I even made my bf buy this hideous stained glass candle holder (at WAL-GREENS) cause I thought it was \"cute\"-that is how out of my mind w\/pain I was. I laid down on the bed and asked for a barf bucket. Just in Case. And did you see what I gave this place? Yeah. Five muthaf'n stars. Don't be a pussy. \n\nI racked my brain all day, trying to come up with a good Phoenix-y place to bring my BFs dad who had driven all the way from Bakersfield and was surely hungry. We needed a place that at 8:30 on a Friday gonna be open and not insane. He is a down home, steak and taters guy, and I am a nervous nelly sophisticate whose lactose intolerance and mostly vegetarian tummy stumps restaurants . And I was hungry after a long day of work. I looked up the menu at work and saw they serve b-fest all day. Oh good, this way I could avoid all the meat, get the waffle, and avoid all \"oh, you don't like meat\" conversation I hate.\n\nEasy enough to find (take the 60 to 17 if you can to avoid Light Rail hell from the 10), we found parking on the street and walked right into the restaurant after seeing the bright neon sign with a mighty Sassy Chicken on front! We were seated immediately (I have no idea what people were talking about regarding the wait- we were lucky is all I can wager) in the same room Kristin C. was: the only four person table besides a two person one, where they have the soda machine, extra canola oil, cash register and silver ware and the kitchen where the amiable cooks sauntered out drinking sweet tea and eating the food. I liked the little hutch over our table with various black studies books. I liked the famous signatures tagged all over the place. \n\nI looked over the two-paged laminated menus-and was stumped. I forgot they had fish tooo....and sides...and omg. I guess the staff is used to a long decision making process, cause they hooked us up on the mason jars of sweet tea (holy shit is it GOOOooooOOOD). We all decided on the platter since it affords you two sides WITH cornbread, and the platter rings in only at $12.50 for battered chicken (3 pieces) or Codfish or Catfish with two sides and cornbread...whhaaaa-considering most sides are at like 3.50...I got the cod (go MA pride!), waffle, collard greens, cornbread. Tim got the chicken, waffle, home fries and his dad got catfish, waffle and homefries. After placing the order (I was gonna get fried okra but since the greens aren't cooked with ham, I went for 'em), it came within ten minutes-like FAST.\n\nWe all dove right into the waffle (I scooped off the butter immediately on to a separate dish in hopes of saving myself a little) and all agreed it was the best waffle ever.\n\n\"This waffle is good.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is\"\n\n\"Oh my...I just had the waffle and it is GOOD.\"\n\nfive minutes later\n\n\"This waffle is really, really good.\"\n\nten minutes later\n\n\"I can't believe how perfect this waffle is\"\n\nIt was like fucking Groundhog Day with this waffle, I couldn't picture a better waffle-not too doughy, not too nutmegy, not too crispy, not too buttermilky, not too cinammonly, not too eggy, not too airy, the little waffle indents weren't too deep or shallow for optimal warmed maple syrup lovin', and I ate the whole damn waffle. My lil' waffle of doom.\n\nI could only manage to eat one piece of Cod (it was as big as my face) and the crunchy, flavourful (but oddly not spicy) batter was perfect with the hot sauce on the table. The cornbread a moist muffin of pure delish-a real compliment, not a star, but a perfect compliment to the rest of the palate. I loved my collared greens and it was spicy, and vaguely sweet, and I ate it gingerly it was that good. In fact even thought I stuffed myself, I still had a whole piece of cod, a 3\/4 of a cornbread muffin, and almost huge bowl of collard greens left over.\n\nWe really wanted that red velvet cake so seductive under the glass dome case on the counter, but as we sat there drinking our refills, the pain started and the dreaminess and sleepiness and regret. \n\nOur guest loved it, kept complimenting me on it (and didn't notice my bizarre eating habits), Tim mentioned if he lived near by he would gain 5,000 pounds, and I can't wait to come back on a weekday early afternoon to have brunch w\/the waffle and GRITS...yummers!!!!!!","useful":11,"funny":13,"cool":11,"type":"review"}

After being seated, I checked in on Yelp and waited for a server. None came. No one even acknowledged my existence. I looked at my Yelp check in time and 15 minutes had passed. I went to the hostess and asked what I needed to do to get a server. Rather than apologize, she made an excuse and said that the server was busy. I hate when people make excuses. Just apologize and fix the problem please. The hostess got me some tea and then the server came immediately. I ordered fried green tomatoes and chicken. Main course arrived almost immediately. Maybe 5 minutes after I ordered. The tomatoes, no where to be seen. I mentioned the tomatoes to the server and they showed up at my table when I was  halfway finished with the meal. I had planned on desert, I wanted to try the pudding, but the waitress brought me the bill before I was finished with the main course without offering desert. I asked her where I needed to go to order desert. She stared at me blankly and said, \"oh, you want desert?\" I told her no, it seems that it would be too much of a bother.\n\nI will never return.

Nice, crunchy, juicy, and very flavorful.  Their waffles are fantastic as well, but my all time favorite has got to be their Stupid Fries.  It's a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers, onions, and chunks of their fried chicken.  I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered, it stays extra crispy under all that sauce.  That's what makes it so darn delicious.  It's definitely a meal in itself.  Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it.  Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing!!\n\nTheir koolaide are awesome as well.  You can't come here and not have their koolaide.  I love their blue but I sometime switch it up to red.

Mostly due to the crap service I've received from the host staff. This last time I was standing in line to get my name on the list and somehow larger parties that came in behind me got put on the list before I was acknowledged at all despite being right there at the stand. I tried to say something, got a server's attention and not the hostess, she scribbled my name down on something, but it definitely wasn't the waiting list to be seated, so we left. Sorry I'm not a family of 7 and just a party of 2 (and white, I guess?).\n\nPrior, it's been the same \"I've got better things to do than help you\" attitude, mostly from the female staff. Servers and host. Male staff is usually fine, so I'm not sure why there's an attitude there. Friends that have gone before also have noted the attitude of the female staff and it's not a case of \"if everyone you talk to is an a-hole, you're the a-hole.\"\n\nFood quality can be hit or miss, too. Kool-Aid is far too sweet (universal across all locations) and I find myself ordering a water to dilute about 30-50% if I did order it. Breasts have been dry, except once. Thighs usually stay juicy, but I've had a couple dry ones as well. Pancakes are alright. Waffles seem like a pancakes in waffle form. Collard green are delicious. The banana pudding, though...

There's really not any other place in Phoenix to go to. Except Mrs. White's. And they weren't open late enough.\n\nI didn't know what to expect. I knew that the food would probably be good. That it was in a ghetto part of town. Not to be on a diet before I got here. The basics. \n\nI was really quite impressed. They had clearly renovated recently. It's bright and stylish and modern. Very busy, and quite loud, thanks to the crowd of people and aforementioned DJ. The food is straight up soul food fare- chicken and waffles, beans and rice, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. You can get kool aid or lemonade or sweet tea in giant mason jars. The food came out quickly, but was piping hot and fresh. (Unlike our experience with the other location.) My chicken had beautifully crispy skin. My grits were okay. A bit thick and gooshy, but really the star of the show here is the chicken, so frankly I didn't care too much that the sides were a little more mediocre. \n\nWe were so stuffed to the gills at the end we had no room for red velvet cake or any of the tempting sweets. Till next time, Lo-lo's. Till next time.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I have never had chicken & waffles before and always wanted to try them since it made no sense to me. We went to the location on Buckeye and I was surprised to see how nice the restaurant was. Very clean, modern, well done. Service was great, felt at home right away. The current menu is a bit confusing with many different options but since I knew I wanted to try the chicken & waffles I ordered the Double D. The waiter suggested fried green tomatoes to start, since I have never had those I said yes! They were good too. Then the chicken and waffles came. Soo good! The batter on the chicken is perfect, I wouldn't change a thing! The crunch and spices are great. The flavor of the waffles were perfect and the syrup was not your standard store bought syrup, it added so much. Loved it. My 3 yr old daughter ordered chicken strips and a waffle, she devoured it. Since then she walks around the house saying \"Lo-Lo's!\" and \"I like Lo-Lo's!\". She want's chicken & waffles everyday now and I agree ! To finish our server suggested banana pudding, I expected some yellow jello-o like pudding, but got a gourmet banana dessert again with great flavor, full banana slices and some sort of crust in there that was awesome. It's obvious the chef's taste their food here, I really can't say enough about how well all the pieces tasted together. I will go back for sure, after I ride my bike, jog, or go swimming :) so many more new things to try, collard greens, shrimp & grits, red velvet cake...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The girls taking down names were Latinas.  The first thought that popped into my head was \"Where all the soul brothas and sistas at?!?\"  You can't have a soul food place, without the folks who invented soul food.  WTH?\n\nBut, alas, my fears were washed away.  Apparently, they were smart and showed up early, before Lo-Lo's opened, to get out of the heat and seated quickly.  Gotta remember that the next time because there is no waiting indoors.  You either gotta stand under a tiny 8x8 tent they set up or along the side of the building in the alley way.  So not cool, when it's already 100 degrees at 10am.  \n\nCan you see me sweating?  Not pretty.\n\nAfter a 35 minute wait, we were quickly shuffled into the a cramped little room.  Our orders were quickly taken.  Not even ten minutes later, the food arrived.  My \"Toy-Toy\" (two fried wings with a waffle) was delish!!  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Crispy skin on the outside, juicy in the middle.  Finger lickin goodness.  The waffle was great, too.  Slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  \n\nI have to admit, this place is waaay better than Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.  Though, I've been a fan of theirs for years, the quality has slipped and the chicken was, more times than not, overcooked.  They're getting kicked to the curb.  Lo-Lo's is now my favorite chicken and waffle place.  \n\nDespite the crampedness (is that even a word?) of the place, I'm still giving it a full 5-stars.  It's worth the wait and worth being up close and personal with your tableside neighbor.  Customer service quick and friendly.  Yes, it's a hole-in-the-wall place, but that's what makes it even more authentic.  It's unique, has a great vibe and great food.

It was 3pcs of smothered chicken w two sides (we had mac n cheese & beans over rice). We had the gravy on the side and added a side of waffles. It also came with a peice of cornbread. I had the sweet tea to drink. The chicken and waffle were still as good as ever. The sides however were not very. Our mac and cheese was really mushy! The flavor was good but the pasta was way overcooked. It almost looked like a bowl of yellow custard. The beans and rice also had great flavor but the rice was a bit undercooked. The cornbread was better than I remembered. I noticed they changed their gravy also. The color is different... more golden than before with little specks of something red. It used to be a light brown gravy with peices of wilted onions. While still good, I liked the old version better. The sweet tea was a little sweeter than normal but I still enjoyed it.\n\nMy friends agreed that the sides could've been better but really enjoyed the chicken and waffles.

I hate to denigrate the original, but Lo-Lo's takes Roscoe's formula and runs away with it.\n\nFirst, their chicken is very, very good. Crispy skin, moist interior, just the right amount of spices. My only beef is I wish the pieces were slightly larger.\n\nSecond, the waffles are excellent and topped with an enormous round of butter. Just they way they should be. Crisp, dripping with butter, delightful.\n\nThird, the sides... oh, lord, the sides. The collard greens are the best greens I've ever eaten, and I've had my fair share of good ones. Cooked perfectly, no bitterness. They make the south proud. The cheese grits are a bowl of cheesy, well cooked goodness and are not to be missed. The mac 'n' cheese was smooth, and bathing in cheese sauce (and did I detect some velveeta in the mix? oh, I believe I did! And this, my friends, is a very good thing), and the cheese eggs were fluffy and perfectly proportioned between eggs, cheese and onions.\n\nFinally, the red velvet cake is an absolute must-- no matter how stuffed you may be. If I could be encased in the frosting I would die a happy young lady.\n\nMy only regret in going to Lo-Lo's was my lack of stomach capacity. Now I'll have to wait a year before I try their fish, peas, and other sumptuous looking offerings.\n\nWord to the wise-- as other reviewers have said, get there early. The folks who run Lo-Lo's are nice as can be and get your food to you in a hurry, but the place is small and it fills up quick. We were in by 10:30 on two separate weekdays and got the last available table both times. Otherwise, you're setting up outside in line.

How dare someone use cream of mushroom soup to make Mac and cheese with! That's a cheap way to make it creamy.

The chicken was cooked perfectly--tender and juicy with a crispy coating that had a nice \"pop\" of seasoning. The mac n' cheese actually had cheesy flavor. All too often, restaurant mac n' cheese leaves me wondering \"where's the cheese?\" Not so at Lo-Lo's. The only (only!) complaint I have is the portion size. It was WAY TOO MUCH!

I'd heard about it from others like some sort of ancient mythology - it sounds amazing and fantastical but you know it can't really be true.  When it comes to Lo-Lo's - believe the hype.\n\nFinding Lo-Lo's: I've driven down Central SO many times and never known how close I really was.  Then one day I saw an arrow spray painted on the side of the building.  \"Lo-Lo's this way!\"  It took a few minutes to realize that that must be THE Lo-Lo's.  I started talking about it w\/ friends and we decided we needed to go.  I confirmed the address and the 3 of us set off for flavor adventure.  Yes, you turn at the arrow (Which you only see when driving North on Central) and it's not much at all past that - but don't expect any huge signs, valet service - or even a parking lot.  You'll park right out on the street - and on a busy night that means you may need to walk a bit.\n\nEntering Lo-Lo's:  Stepping through the doors = Waiting area.  Taking 2 steps into Lo-Lo's = Standing in front of someone's table while they are eating.  You can tell this used to be someone's house - and it was a small house at that.  There are just a few \"rooms\" for seating - and the largest has 5 tables.  Our first time there we sat in the room that has just two tables - a 4 and a 2 top - but it's also where the cash register is, where folks pick up to go orders, where they refill the drinks\/silverware, where they store extra items that were purchased in bulk and has the doorway to the kitchen and you have to walk through that room to get to the other rooms.  In some places you might think this was the worst table in the house.  At Lo-Lo's I would disagree with you.  We got to listen in on the best conversations and we had the best view of all the amazing food going to the different rooms.  \n\nThe Food:  Sweet Tea served in a big Mason Jar.  SOLD!  It was awesome and the refills kept coming.  Soul Food without Sweet Tea is just wrong to me.  As for the rest of the Menu - it's not 30 pages long - in fact I'm pretty sure it's just one piece of paper written on both sides.  And yet it's still SO hard to choose.  The first time we went each of us got something slightly different.  Both my eating companions got some version of a meal that included both Chicken and Waffles.  I bucked the trend and got their Salmon Croquettes with Cheese Eggs, Grits and Waffles.  I could talk for days about how amazing their food is.  Best Eggs I'd ever had.  I am not a big egg person and I was craving these eggs again for a month.  The more I think about them the more I want to go.  The Salmon was amazing - I took one home and it was big enough I made myself a sandwich with it the next day.  The sides are all absolutely amazing.  The Greens have an amazing sweetness aftertaste that I am completely unable to describe.  The Chicken.  Oh, the Chicken.  Let's start w\/ this.  I've always thought fried chicken was \"ok\".  I went with 2 folks who love fried chicken - and make their own family handed down recipes.  After their first bites it looked like they had found the holy grail.  It was the best fried chicken I'd ever eaten.  Guess what I've saved for last?  The waffles.  I always eat waffles or pancakes last for 2 reasons 1) They are SO sweet just like a desert and 2) I can only eat a few bites worth.  They are usually too sweet, too sticky, and very quickly mushy.  So, I spread around the butter (removing most of it of course) and drizzled it with some syrup.  It was the lightest, yummiest, buttery heavenly thing I'd ever had.  These were not just waffles.  These were Waffles.  I ate almost the whole thing.  As for Lo-Lo's desert menu - I've heard great things about their Red Velvet cake - but I've never quite been able to get that far into my meal and still order more.  Maybe next time.\n\nService: We've always had great service.  Servers are usually young and have that \"I'm working at my uncle's restaurant for the summer\" quality - but they are fast, knowledgeable and quick on the refills. \n\nAtmosphere: If you are from certain parts of the valley - Lo-Lo's may be a bit of a culture shock.  Yes, it is quite possible if you are of the Caucasian persuasion - you may be the only one there during your entire meal.  I've heard some folks say they would be \"afraid\" to go because of that.  My thought?  Get the heck over it.  Should a black person be afraid to go to AZ 88 or Flemings because they might be the only black person there?  Heck no.  And wouldn't you think they were silly for even thinking it?  Exactly.\n\nOverall: Prices are good.  I honestly can't remember how much anything costs.  I blame the food.  But I do remember thinking \"wow, is that all?\" every time we go.  Location is downtown - just minutes from AWA.  Food is out of this freaking world.  Calorie content is... well...  it's not something I like to think about.","useful":8,"funny":7,"cool":6,"type":"review"}

The portions are crazy big and might satisfy GODZILLA.\n\nLong Story-\nThis pack was PACKED with people early at lunch time. The hostess informed us that it would be a half hour wait and her prediction was very accurate as it was. We ordered and our server brings out our beverages in large canning jars. We wait and wait and then our server informs us that the kitchen is backed up and it will be a while for our food to arrive. So we wait and wait and were are real hungry by now. Our food does eventually arrive sometime after a half hour.\n\nI received a soul food platter. You have many choices on how to build your platter and I picked a chicken thigh, a fish, and two sides. This platter also comes with a corn bread.\n\nChicken- Good! Crispy Skin, Seasoned Nice, Moist!\n\nFish- Awful- Served broken in half, over cooked with a terrible ultra thick corn meal coating that might have been a 1\/3 of an inch thick. \n\nMacaroni and cheese- so-so-better than average for processed tasting cheese. Strong process cheese taste but doctored up well. Pasta was slightly over cooked. I note that I don't care for processed tasting Macaroni and Cheese. I know that most people only eat and make it that way so you might feel different than me depending on your taste.\n\nSpicy Green Beans with Red Potatoes- Not Good- The green beans seemed almost canned. The beans might have been frozen but were very grey and over cooked. The potatoes seemed either steamed or boiled. They were not appetizing at all.\n\nCorn Bread with GIANT ball of soft Butter- Good- sort of cake like, a little sweet and studded with corn. Tasted like a mix of cake with cornbread with LOTS of butter soaking in. It was like having a rich dessert. Also giant sized. You will hurt your self if you eat the whole thing.\n\nMy husband had the #3 Lo Lo's Plate. It cost $2.00 less than my plate and was a much better value. He had three pieces of chicken and waffles. I tasted a small piece of waffle and it was good.\n\n\n\nBetween the wait, The not so good fish, processed tasting macaroni and cheese and the not appetizing spicy green beans with red potatoes and the $42.35..brought things down for me.\n\n\nIf you stick with only the things that Lo Lo's does best you will do better than I did.  Go there when you are monstrously hungry.\n\n3 Stars according to Yelp means A-OK and worth a try. \n\n\nI give three stars when it's a mixed review with some reservations.","useful":2,"funny":3,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

It's a corner restaurant and wasn't difficult to miss with big enough signs.  \nThe parking lot at the side of the restaurant was on the small side and packed.  Thankfully at the time of our arrival a couple of people were leaving so we got lucky to snag a parking spot.  There's a parking lot across a small street opposite the restaurant which I believe can be used to park as I saw other patrons parking there as well.\n\nThe restaurant had plenty of seating both inside, what looked like a back area, and an outside area though there weren't any folks dining outside due to the hot weather but the misters were on.\nThe restaurant was clean and well lit from light from the outside and inside.  \nNoise levels was high with all the dining folks, and I believe there was music playing in the background.  Large screened TV's adorned the walls but were on mute.  The walls also contained paintings and pictures of various musicians and stars.\nMy suggestion for an arrival time would be early.  We arrived at\/around 1-1:30 in the afternoon and there was a wait of about 30 minutes plus the waiting area was packed with only standing room left.\nThere's only one entry point into the restaurant from the parking lot and that would be on S Central Ave itself.  As you enter, you're greeted by staff then you provide them with your name and how many are in your party.  \nIf you choose, you can wait around by the door as most people were doing if the one couch they have is occupied or wait outside as I also witnessed folks doing.\n\nMenus - while you wait, you can grab a to-go menu (many copies available) to have a gander of what's on the menu as it was similar to the real one that's provided when you're finally seated.\nWhen you're seated, you're provided with a 4-page colorful, self-explanatory menu that also contained drinks and desserts as well (can't remember if I saw that on the to-go menu).  \n\nService - All staff, from the folks that greeted us at the front door to our waitress, was super friendly.  \nThe waitress explained everything and asked if we ever dined there before.  She provided suggestions of the favorite dishes that folks ordered and checked on us periodically throughout our stay.\n\nFood - For me I ordered The Famous Soulfood Platter which came with your 1 choice from eight items plus two sides and it came with a cornbread.  From the 8 items, I chose the 3 pieces of chicken (Southern fried).  You can opt for random pieces or you can pick which ones you want.  For me, I went with the leg, a wing, and breast.  For my 2 sides, I chose the mac n' cheese and the rice with beans.\nThe wifesky, ordered The Cool Bre Bre's Chicken Salad (field greens, white meat chicken, candied walnuts, cherry tomatoes, avocado, applewood bacon & your choice of ranch, raspberry or balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing) and it was huge!  She almost didn't finish but she managed to push through.\nFor my meal, first the sides - the mac n' cheese - served in a small bowl but was of a heaping portion and wasn't too dried out and sticky, and wasn't too runny either.  It was done just about right because you can't have mac n' cheese done too runny or too dried out in my opinion.  \nThe rice with beans was to die for.  My only regret was not ordering another side of it.  The rice was well cooked and fresh plus the beans...not sure if it was red beans because it didn't look like baked beans was done to perfection!  It was well cooked and the sauce\/gravy it was served in was nicely seasoned with a small kick to it.\nThe chicken was moist, tender, succulent, fresh, and cooked perfectly.  It was well seasoned and the fried skin\/batter wasn't overwhelming so it had enough bite\/crunch to it.  The chicken wasn't too oily\/greasy \nIt was truly Southern styled, comfort food!\n\nDefinitely would love to come back to try those oversized Belgium waffles I was seeing on other folks plates!  You truly won't regret your visit here!","useful":27,"funny":13,"cool":18,"type":"review"}

As a California girl, I know almost nothing about grits.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=UP5-xhOoSN3C3JLURcrXJA\n* Chili and corn muffin - The chili was made with beans and beef, and was delicious. The corn muffin seemed pretty dry - waffles are way better here. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=PojMqwuCAdilemZILlH1AA\n* Mac n' cheese - Creamy and satisfying. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=apV6OcH9iItBhrm8An33nw\n* Collard greens - Spicy, the flavor seemed a bit muddled, but it was a-okay. \n* Red velvet cake - This was one of the best RV cakes I've tried. Incredibly moist (how did they do it?), very sweet, with fresh pecans on the frosting. I recommend ordering a slice to go, since you'll likely be to full to enjoy it after eating all this heavy food. http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=l12Isv2RMc5q0LRuYmD4wA\n\nI was glad to have found this special soul food restaurant.

They're good at what they do, and treat everybody the same- which is quite well - even if you're a patronizing N. Phx yuppie on your annual sociological trek down to the hood.

This restaurant was suggested to us and we were so excited about getting some good ol Southern Food. I truly would have given 5 stars if I was basing this review on food alone. However; this review is based off our entire experience.  First let's starts with the \n\nPros: the front door staff\/ hostess where extremely friendly and were able to seat our party of five in a decent amount of time. The food absolutely hands down delicious. The chicken was moist and perfectly fried to perfection. My collard greens had the right amount of flavor and heat to taste. Don't get me started on the waffles omg AMAZING. I truly enjoyed my food so to the cooks GREAT JOB.\n\nNow on to the \n\nCons: our waitress Edith although friendly was not that attentive. I ordered the catfish appetizer and specifically requested it come out prior to our meal.. well that never happened because our food came out before the appetizer. I had to let her know that I no longer wanted it because it was late coming to the table. Also she rarely returned to our table after our orders came out and seemed like other waitstaff was picking up her slack. She forgot or it just took several minutes for her to bring things that our party requested back to the table. For example I order sweet tea which I didn't get until I wad half way through with my meal. Once finished we requested some Togo boxes and a bag which the boxes came out but no bag then had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the bag and check. \n\nAfter paying for our meal and getting back home I noticed I was still charged for the catfish appetizer. I called the restaurant and was told to hold while they get Edith on the phone. Once she got on the phone and I explained my calling she said to please hold while she gets the manager to adjust the charges to only be hung up on. I called back and then was reconnected to Edith and was told to hold again while charges are reversed. I waited on hold for about 10 to 15 minutes when finally was told charges had been adjusted. I am just hoping in the few business days it takes to show the reversal on my card that it actually does. \n\nAll and all I loved the restaurant, food, and friendly atmosphere. But didn't care so much for the service received.  I would definitely recommend coming here to eat and enjoy the soulful cooking.  Just note that some staff training maybe needed.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It had charm and character, but now the shack is gone and larry has gained about 25 pounds and they have two locations and there is exposed lighting and nice booths and T-shirts for sale. Hey, when the cash gods give you your chance to cash in, you might as well, but some places don't sell out and its too bad that this place has fancied itself up. The food though was pretty much what I remember, although Waffle House has better, crispier waffles. The chicken is still top quality, but not the \"best ever\" anymore, hey something has too suffer when your expanding. The home fries were outstanding with huge chunks of real potatoes and a healty dose of onions and two colors of peppers on top and the sweet tea was terrific in it's mason jar for 3 bucks. It's still clearly worthy of a visit by tourist and local, but if your in a real good fried chicken place in the South, you will wait 25 minutes for fresh chicken.

I think that the parking and wait area issues needed to be addressed during the planning stages of the expansion\/remodel. The place is beautiful, but lacks key components: a place for customers to wait (they have a patio with a misting system, but this may not suit everyone) and to park their vehicles. The hostile lady needs to go. That is a HR issue. Please don't tell people to wait outside in 100 degree plus weather.  On the bright side, they are so busy that they need more room ( add a second floor and acquire more parking?). I will park in the sketchy neighborhood, ignore the hostile lady and try to wait inside for their delicious food, but not everyone is willing to run a gauntlet for a meal.

Typically the restaurant is pretty loud during busy hours. Also they have a live DJ who mostly appropriate music that all guest can enjoy. The restaurant has a country\/industrial theme. The outside seating area is nice for when you wait, which is almost guaranteed if you come for dinner especially on weekends. A big bonus is the restaurant has valet parking that is free (but please tip). I suspect it could be because the fence on north side is always being hit by customers. The parking lot is not large enough to accommodate the restaurant when at full capacity. Addition parking is on the neighborhood streets or across the street and industrial building. Most of staff are young and spirited. Service: it's not what I wish it would be. Food comes out at various times, which can be annoying if you get your food and you party gets theirs 15 minutes later. This seem to be more so with parties of 4 or more. The managers are pretty stiff and rigid. Definitely not \"the customer is always right\" type. They are not friendly and spunky like the waiters. They're expanding by adding locations at a face pace due to them franchising the restaurant. Hopefully they can get the customer service level up and earn the fifth star. Lastly the crowd is very diverse at all times. Black owned and operated which is a plus for me.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I will never return to this location. \n\nThis is the third and final time I will set foot in this location. Todays encounter was by far the worst. My mother called in a to go order because she figured it would be busy. When my son arrived we stood at the door as there were several people waiting to be seated. I received a text from my mother informing me that it would be an hour for the order to be ready. I looked around and there were several empty tables in the middle of the room, 2 empty booths along the window and the banquest room was empty. I approached the counter and asked the hostess if it was really going to take an hour to get a to go? She replied yes, we have people sitting at tables that havent had their orders filled in 30 mins or more. i directed her sight to the multiple open tables and asked for an explanation. She said \"OBVIOUSLY WE'RE BUSY\"!! I then asked to speak with the manager, whom happened to be walking up. I stepped to the side to address the manager. I informed the manager that this was my 3rd attempt at getting a to go order. I explained that my family and I go to the Scottsdale location very often. From the start the manager was very condescending. I informed him of my most recent visit to simply get dessert,(Which on that visit I was informed that they were'nt doing to go orders because it slows down the kitchen. But they would see if they could get me a slice of cake)! After explaining my frustration to the manager his reply was simply \"oh well\", while staring blankly into my face. I asked the manager for his name which he gladly offered while extending his hand, \"I'M LARRY WHITE, THE OWNER... I AM LoLo!' Raising his voice and gripping my hand as if to intimidate me! I shook his hand as he squeezed like we were at some stand off in the playground, childish attempt to display authority! I politely informed Mr. White that there was no need to attempt aggression and raise his voice. I reminded him that I was calm and the tone in my voice had not changed AND I would appreciate it if he would not attempt to disrespect me in front of my 4yr old by raising his voice to me. I thanked Mr. White and requested that he cancel my mothers to go order request. \nAs mentioned, my family and I are loyal patrons of the Scottsdale location. It is really sad that the level of service is not the same. But here is a suggestion, maybe if your kitchen staff cannot handle the level of business that you do, HIRE MORE STAFF!!! Or better yet, turn down the music and have the DJ help out! It's a restaurant not a night club.

We were only made to wait for a short time before we entered the shrine of soul food. We were greeted very warmly and asked what we wanted to drink. I had the sweet tea. I usually LOVE sweet tea but they were not messing around! Next time I'll order 1\/2 sweet and 1\/2 regular tea. For my meal, I got the 2 piece and a waffle. We chose several sides to share between the three of us. We had the red beans and rice, mac and cheese, collard greens and fried okra. \nI was amazed when the food arrived at the table. The waffle was hanging off of the side of my plate and smelled like heaven probably should! I tried the fried chicken and I was taken back to my childhood. The chicken was well seasoned and has a bit of baking powder bite to it! AMAZING. It wasn't at all greasy or soggy in any way. My mouth is watering just typing this review. In the background, there was great gospel music playing so I hope that getting a dose of Jesus while eating fried chicken might banish any of its artery clogging properties.... yeah.... \nWe were checked on several times to see if we needed anything and we were treated cordially.

Though most people go for the chicken and waffles, I much more prefer their smothered chicken with hash browns, collared greens, and sweet yams.  Be forewarned -- the smothered chicken is salty.  Much saltier than most people would prefer, tbh, at least if their palate is fairly \"white\" (as in not eating a lot of spices and salt and whatnot).\n\nThe sweet tea is always phenomenal and the red velvet cake is comparable to stuff I've eaten back East (i.e. it's fantastic).\n\nFor first timers, you will probably get \"the itis\" after eating here: make sure you have someone else with you who can handle the insulin overload and can drive you home.  I had taken an ex here after showing her The Boondocks episode about the itis (I know, I know) and she thought it was a myth until she started nodding off in the restautant itself.

I had 20 people who RSVP'd to me that they would be coming so I called Lolo's Friday around 4:30 to make reservations because I know how busy that location gets on the weekend. I have made reservations at this location several times before and was told that there would be a $1.00 reservation per person but this time I was told that it would be $5.00 per person. I told the guy that took my reservation that it would not be a problem so he asked me for my credit card to make reservations for 20 people. I called back the next day (Saturday) at 1:50 because I had 7 more people that I had to add to our reservation and they said that would not be a problem they would just have to charge $5.00 per person to add them and I said that was fine because I knew even if we did not get that money refunded we would be spending at least that much. We had a great dinner and our waitress separated our bills like we asked when we had placed our orders. She came out gave everyone their bill and two people paid right away because they had to leave. When everyone else was ready to pay the waitress never came back so I had to go and find out what was going on. This is when I am finally being told that they had already charged my card for the entire party $541.00. I then told the Manager that we had asked for separate bills before we ordered. Then he says that I was charged $25.00 per person because I had made reservations. Well first if all if that was true the amount would not be $541.00 it would have been $500.00 for 20 people because they charged my card Friday the day before I even added the extra 7 people so that is a lie. Then I am being told that because I reserved the party room I was being charged some type of catering party package and they start showing me this contract that I have never seen before. I then tell Chris and the Manager that I did not ask to be put in a party room and if they chose to seat our large party there then that was their choice. I have made reservations there before for our company with large groups and it had never been an issue before. I then ask the waitress what the total bill was for our entire party and she says it was $440.00 so they are overcharging us $101.00! Then they tried to say it was because they charge $25.00 per person and I then told them if it would make sense for someone to make reservations for $25.00 per person when the most expensive item on the menu is $15.00, ridiculous! The manager then had to call the owner twice to explain the situation because they were not going to refund our money. After 40 minutes of him going back and forth on phone with the owner he finally got the approval to give us the refund. First I had to pay our tab which was over $200.00 and then because there were two families that had paid and left I had to pay their tabs too because they had issued a refund back to their cards because they actually thought that we were going to just pay the $541.00 like we were idiots! So I ended up paying $140.00 for those tabs as well. Then the manager goes to do our refund and he does not have the authorization to complete a refund for that amount, UNBELIEVABLE! So then we are told that we would get a call back on Sunday to get it taken care of and nobody calls us back so I have to end up calling them. I talked to Chris on the phone and he then tells me that the owners are on vacation and they will not be able to issue the refund until they come back to town. What kind of owners does not empower their managers to make decisions and issue refunds, but also what type of customer service is that! I ended up having over $800.00 taken out of our account just for dinner!! The account that was used belongs to our club team account that is a non-profit, so now our team is out $541.00 that is raised by the players with sponsorships and donations to use to pay for gym fees and tournaments and now we do not have those funds to use. That is not all, I then call another location and I am told that the owners are not on vacation and the only way to communicate with them is to go online and submit a request, even after we had given specific instructions to the managers Saturday night that we wanted a phone call from the owners. I sent this exact letter to the owners on their website like I was told and to this day I still have not received one response from anyone at Lolo's. I had to dispute the charges with my bank finally because our team needs the money to pay for our gym this week and a tournament. Don't ever trust Lolo's with your credit card because they will lie to you.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The restaurant is large with decent free parking.\n\nThe menu is straight up soul food with lots of fried and smothered options. I opted for the Sheeda's Special which included a breast, wing, and one waffle. The food was delivered very fast combined with a large jar of unsweet iced tea.\n\nMy chicken was juicy and cooked well, although the coating had a bit too much flour. It was seasoned well and complimented the house hot sauce at each table.

It's been on my AZ bucket list for 2 years. To say I was excited would be an understatement. I was dancing in anticipation. It wasn't very busy which seemed like a plus. We were seated immediately. Seemed like another plus. We waited about 50 minutes for our food- soul crushing. As we watched people who were seated long after us be served my rumbling tummy began to wonder where the F my food was. Our waitress didn't come back that entire time to check on us so I couldn't really update my stomach on the sitch. On a time restraint and irritated my adorable boyfriend (I have one now) flagged down an employee and ask them to check on our order as basically everyone else in the restaurant but us was eating. At this point our waitress finally surfaced for the first time in 45 minutes. We asked her how everyone who was seated after us was already eating and she told us TO ASK THE KITCHEN. Are you kidding me?! Also, they messed up my boyfriend's order and didn't give him all his food but we couldn't tell her because she vanishes like.. I don't know, anything that vanishes quickly and for long periods of time that doesn't want to return. We asked for the manager at this point and told him what the waitress said\/ about the wait\/ the food and he also blamed the kitchen. I feel really bad for the inanimate kitchen at this point. It gets blamed for everything. I don't think the kitchen is to blame when people who come in well after us get their food before us but I also haven't really worked in the industry so I might be wrong. Strong sense says she simply didn't put our food in and doesn't know how to take responsibility. The manager didn't apologize for the waitress' attitude or take anything off the bill for us waiting nearly an hour and messing up our order or for their service. He did offer a free dessert, however, it was 10 in the morning and we were already over their bologna. My suggestion- Take some ownership! This was our first time in your establishment. You guys messed up. You let us sit there for 50 minutes after we placed our order watching people who sat down after us eating without ever checking in on us. We had to flag you down. Your waitress told us to go in the back AND ASK THE KITCHEN WHAT WAS TAKING SO LONG. Listen, if I knew I could freely go in the kitchen I would have made a snack because I was hungry as all get out. \n\nThe  foodie in me and die hard downtownian is deeply disappointed and will likely never go back or recommend. \n\nI gave it two stars because the chicken and waffles were alright.. the restaurant was clean. I got a refill on my coffee in my cute ass Lolo's mug from someone who was not my rude waitress.. although since I'm here writing this I might as well say that the mug had a large chip on the rim some could say is a liability. The hot sauce was good. I am a big hot sauce girl. My water came with a lemon which could be construed as classy and didn't taste like gross AZ tap and one waitress had cute hair and smiled at me..so that was nice.","useful":6,"funny":8,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I had bookmarked this place even before we had left for TX, so I made it clear that when we head back after our trip...we would come here to eat.\n\nWe did that.\n\nIt was really easy to find. Pulling in I could see there were people waiting outside for their turn at some Lolos. We didn't get deterred because it didn't look that bad of a wait. Entering the restaurant...it was packing in there! It was a Sunday afternoon around 1 something, and it was filled! Anyway, we were told twas going to be a 45 minute wait. Initially, I thought crap...only because we had been driving since El Paso and there were hungry lions to be fed. THANKFULLY, we didn't have to wait for 45 minutes. Apparently, most the folks waiting ahead of us lost patience and left. Welp, yay for us. Hallelujuer. Think we waited for about 20minutes.\n\nWe get seated and was not immediately greeted by a waiter\/tress. But, I didn't mind because we were trying to tame these wild animals into their seats all while trying to stare at the menu (which btw we were already staring at the to-go menus they had available as we were waiting to be seated). I'd say 5 minutes later our waitress comes by and tells us she'll be right with us as she has dirty plates in tow. \n\nShe comes back, we order immediately. Hungry and on a time battle here. I ordered the toy-toy. 2 wings and a waffle. The boys ordered their chicken tenders that come with cornbread, and the husband orders 3pc chicken with waffles. \n\nDining out I am not one to order fried chicken. Mainly because I've tried chicken that isn't home cooked and they've all tasted nasty. Like, well cooked on the outside...still soggy from the batter on the inside, salty, peppery, lack of meat, oily, etc...so ordering the 2 wings was ideal for me because incase I did not like the chicken...it wouldn't be much chicken to eat, thus, wouldn't be much chicken to go to waste.\n\nNever fails, the 1 time I'm being cautious is the 1 time.im thinking, damnt! Their chicken was NOT dry. It was moist, seasoned properly, and just cooked almost perfectly. I say almost because I like my wings to be extra crispy. But for someone who doesn't order chicken dining out, it was close to perfect. The waffle was nice and soft with crisp edges. \n\nTried my boys tenders and those things were fat and moist as well! The cornbread, however, which comes with their plate was overcooked. You could tell it was just by looking at it. It looked like it was 5 minutes away from becoming burnt. I love cornbread. However, I didn't love cornbread on this day. \n\nAlso, the fries that came with my boys' plates...I felt were way too seasoned. I had to dust off the seasoning just so my toddler can enjoy it properly. It just became way too salty after each fry. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a chicken and waffle joint. Their chicken and waffle did not disappoint at all! They do have LOTS of other items on their menu if chicken and waffles aren't your fancy. I can see where people may feel they are pricey in some parts of their menu, but from my quick experience...it's worthed. I really wish we had more time so I could explore their other items, but we will save that for another trip. We had a nice experience, despite the children going wild. Lol. Will DEFINITELY return and will definitely put my stamp of recommendation.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

That's why I ate it there and didn't wait to get it home. The Mac n cheese was good. Not great. It wasn't as creamy as I thought or wanted it to be. It was kind of thick. The kool aid tasted bad.

I don't know that there is anything on the menu that is bad! My boyfriend and I wanted to go out to eat on a Saturday night. We were starved but couldn't decide. I usually pick the region of food and he picks the restaurant (bc he's from here and I'm not). I said hearty American food or American bistro. We decide as we're walking to the car....CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. So random. \n\nWe get to Lolo's and I'm loving the atmosphere. The art on the walls is cool. The music is good. Everyone looks happy to be stuffing their faces. I see mason jars with colorful drinks all over which really sparked my interest. BUT decided against booze and went with a traditional sweet tea. Holy cow was this sweet tea everything I hoped it would be. It reminded me of sweet tea in the south. Like Georgia south. The REAL south. Not too sugary but not super bitter. It was just right and so refreshing. \n\nWe got an app sampler platter. Fried okra, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, and slaw. The fried okra was crispy and seasoned to perfection. The potatoes were creamy. The mac n cheese was probably my favorite. You know when the cheese is sharp enough that it doesn't need seasoning and does that warm gooey thing when you pull it apart. Ya ...it was like that! The slaw wasn't soggy like most slaw is at bbq joints. It was still crispy and very flavorful. \n\nThen dinner came! We both opted for chicken and waffles. The chicken was so moist and the batter was fried for the perfect amount of time. Its like they have it down to a science in the kitchen here. The outside is crispy and seasoned well and the inside is moist and hot. The waffle was delicious. It almost had a sweet flavor too it. It wasn't chewy it wasn't soggy. It was as if the food was plated, put in the window, and whisked away to our tables immediately. Each bite I took I made sure to have an equal chicken to waffle ratio and dabbed it in syrup then in a little hot sauce. My mouth is watering just reminiscing about this meal lol.

The food was not good. I usually splurge when I come to Lolo's but yesterday it was horrible. My toddler didn't even eat their mac and cheese. It was so dry and disgusting. No more Lolo's for me.   We ordered two meals and my total came out to be almost $40.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We just made a deal with the devil and we didn't even know it. \n\nThat or I was just too hungry to function properly.\n\nBut I do know that I would do terrible, devious things in the name of these chicken and waffles. Pawnshops would know me by name and assume I had a hard drug problem, but my only addiction would be the sweet fried perfection of Lolo's Chicken and Waffles!\n\nPerfectly spiced, crisp but not overly battered, moist fried chicken that even Colonel Sanders would sell his soul for, provided he hasn't already done so in his quest for chicken dominance. \n\nCrunchy, buttery waffles with a hint of sweetness that are good on their own or smothered in warm maple syrup, that totally wipe the floor with those perpetratin' Waffle House hockey pucks.\n\nCreamy, cheesy, smooth and decadent mac and cheese. A tribute to the best of Granny's kitchen and an affirmation that Kraft should be drawn and quartered for their powdered cheese monstrosity.\n\nAnd sweet tea that quenches the thirst and makes your teeth hurt its so effing good! Or red Kool-aid, lemonade, fountain drinks, or regular unsweetened tea for you nonbelievers out there.\n\nAlmost everything at Lolo's is done well, except for their red velvet cake. It's dense and moist but the devil's food taste (it's chocolate cake with about three bottles of red food coloring in it for those of you that think red is the flavor) is weak and the cream cheese frosting was so thin that there wasn't nearly enough to lubricate the bland, meaty red slice. It was a disappointment. \n\nBut on the bright side, maybe this is confirmation that we didn't make a deal with the devil, cuz his cake was weak.","useful":5,"funny":9,"cool":8,"type":"review"}

Let me just say, I can't believe it took me 4 years to come here, no seriously, I have to slap myself silly for that because LoLo's has renewed my faith in fried chicken. Seriously, I think that was the best fried chicken I've had in my life. The chicken was fried to a perfection, nice golden crisp with minimal grease, that's right, MINIMAL grease! I didn't think that was physically possible for fried chicken but LoLo's debunked that myth! I have the #7, which was 3 chicken wings and a waffle. I've already swooned over the fried chicken, now the waffle was ok, nothing too special, same stuff you get at a waffle house. I still can't get over the friend chicken though.....Anyways, I really liked the atmosphere here, on the south end of downtown, this place gets crazy packed for lunch.

I hadn't been here since they were just a back room to somebody's kitchen so seeing the expansion gave me high hopes because it presented itself nicely...the interior is the ONLY thing that presents itself well.\n\nWe walk in and the unenthusiastic hostess asked how many was in our party and I told her 8.  Being that the rest of the party live further, it would take them a while, so she informed us she can't seat half of our party until the full 8 showed up. Ugh yeah, right. I'm hungry and I'm not waiting so we just asked to be seated for our four. So after letting her know it would just be us for, she writes my name and instructs me to \"scoot\"  to the side and sit down. In slow motion, I turn around and all of the waiting benches are taken soooo where the hell am I suppose to sit, on the older ladies lap that was already sitting there?! She could have easily said \"it will just be a few moments, if you'd like you can take a seat that's available behind you\". Was that too difficult?! So I say whatever, they sat us within the next two minutes.\n\nOur waiter\/manager of the restaurant takes our drink orders and he seemed pretty cool cuz he was joking a lil with us.  So my cousin asks if she can put in an order for someone who was showing up a little later and then that's when things went down hill.  We were informed we couldn't do that because it would be cold by the time he came and blah blah blah.  Brotha, that's another order which results into money into your business' pocket.  So we order our food but he let's us order for our cousin who would show up late.  So we place the order and literally 5 minutes later, a different server comes out and says \"UM this is for someone showing up late or somethin\".  Ok, so you mean to tell me there was a discussion about this tiny little request in your kitchen amongst several servers.  Not to mention our order hadn't even come out yet, so the \"complicated\" order was first to come out when our orders were the smallest.  My friend asks why my cousins order came out so fast and why we haven't received ours, so that's when the title of this review comes in \"ma'am we cook chicken and waffles all day, some orders will be quicker than others\". Huh?! I know I didn't major in computer science but this really wasn't THAT complex.  So luckily my cousin walks in just in time to eat his food so it didn't get cold like Mr. Manager\/Waiter\/Host\/Fry Cook (he seriously wore many hats) mentioned. \n\nI don't wanna come to a place to eat when there's all these rules and instructions beginning with who and how many people can sit with me.  Being a California native, Roscoe's will always be THE Chicken & Waffles place that dominates any other competition.  Compared to Roscoe's, this place is amateur.  At least with Scoes they seat you no matter what time your party arrives, your food comes out within 5-10 minutes from the time you place your order, and you have a server who is just that...a server.  Not the building instructor, valet attendant or whatever our so called 'server' was to us.  This place will never get my business ever again.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

We were the 5th group in line and by the time the doors opened there was a pretty good sized line. As soon as we sat down I got up to use the bathroom (morning coffee works fast!) and noticed that EVERY table was full. I mean every table (this is approximately 45 seconds after opening the doors). \n\nNow, I worked in the restaurant business for over 5 years and that would have been a NIGHTMARE at any of the places I worked at. I was intrigued to see how they would handle it. \n\nThey used a \"shotgun\" approach to serving, we saw at least half a dozen servers throughout our entire meal asking and getting us what we needed. The service was not notably friendly, but it was fast and efficient and there was almost always a server within earshot if we needed something. I have no complaints here, but I am relatively easy to please on the service side (probably the 5 years doing it myself ;)\nAnyway, on to the food, we all tried to order so that we could try all the \"famous\" items. So I ended up having some of each of the following: Chicken, Waffles, Grits, Cheese Eggs, and Fried Okra.\nI am going start at the best and move down. One caveat before we begin, I am not at all a fried chicken fan, I eat it on occasion but have never been excited about it or sought it out. \n\n1.) The Chicken: It was absofreakinlutely amazing. I am talking breathtakingly good. I'm talking take a bite and then hold it out in front of you to look at it to make sure it is just a piece of fried chicken in your hand. It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and not at all greasy. I don't know what they put in the batter but it was awesome. I am starting to salivate right now actually. I did try it true southern style with syrup on it, which was good, but I stopped because I felt the syrup was detracting from the overall flavor. I am not going to attempt to describe the taste, you are just going to have to go and try it for yourself; I will never do it justice. By FAR the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. All of this impression was with going in there with REALLY high expectations, if that tells you something.\n\n2.) The Waffles: Like I just mentioned, I went to Lo Lo's with really high expectations because of friends and Yelp reviews. I was not disappointed here either. They were very, very tasty, and even slightly exceeded my expectations. They are the best waffles I have ever had, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, smothered in butter and syrup YUM. I cleared my plate despite the physical pain of eating so much. I would go back here just for the waffles, but I have to admit, the margin by which the chicken exceeded my expectations was much larger.\n\n3.) The Grits: They were very good; I probably won't get them next time, not because they were lacking but because they would take up valuable chicken and waffle space in my stomach. My only previous experience with grits was in the Army, and obviously, this was an entirely different species of grits.\n\n4.) The Cheese Eggs: These were tasty, fluffy and cheesy, overall exceptional eggs. Mine got a little syrup and butter on them which actually were really good. I can't decide if I would forfeit more bits of chicken and waffles for them though =P\n\n5.) The Fried Okra: Also very good, and a great appetizer. We had a native Texan with us who is a rabid okra fan and she said they were the best fried okra she had ever had. For me though, they will likely go the way of the grits next time.\n\nFor drinks we all got tea, mine was the only unsweet one (which was really good). The sweet tea fans in the group said it was the best sweat tea they have had in Arizona.\n\nOverall we got our food fast, our drinks stayed full and the food was phenomenal and even better than were expecting (and we were expecting greatness). I will now be a regular customer and am going to start browbeating my friends that haven't tried it yet to go with me ;)\n\nLo Lo, I sincerely hope this restaurant has made you a wealthy man because it would be a crime if it hasn't.","useful":6,"funny":3,"cool":7,"type":"review"}

I'm from out of state and I've never been to Lolos I was excited to eat there as their menu has a lot of variety and delicious things.  Back to the stank attitudes, we had a large party their waiting area is small we were constantly harassed to move out of the entry which we were not blocking. By he tried to make us go outside in 106 wether.  Sorry I'm not used to that heat and even with misters outside I was not going to go.   The approach and attitude these girls oozed was just plain Ghetto.  Their tone, body language and demeanor was just foul!  Their manager Antjuan (the one with the gold grill) also not helpful.

Unfortunately, with limited food to choose from and slow service (despite the feeling we got that everyone working was just trying to go home and not be bothered) - tonight was the exception. \n\nWe had butts in the booth at 9:59 tonight, and as the waitress handed us menus we were told they only serve chicken and waffles after 10 pm. NO sides - no eggs - nothing but chicken and waffles. Couldn't even get a salad. Fine, except that the table immediately ahead of us was able to order whatever they wanted, and we were the only other table waiting to order. Seriously, guys? The cut-off is THAT strict? We could HEAR that family order. That's BS. Not to mention, since all we had to choose from was chicken and waffles, why waste our time by giving us menus? Y'all. Get it together. \n\nThen, 20 minutes AFTER we put our order in (which was at 10:05 btw), a server delivers mac-n-cheese to a different table. Tell me again why you can't send a side over to our table at the same time? Smh. \n\nSomewhere between being charged for a lemonade we didn't order and it taking forever for the waitress to come back for our checks, I lost a little faith in Lolo's. I usually eat a lot earlier and now that I know about it, the limited menu after 10 won't be an issue for me. I just won't come then. \n\nThe service tonight WAS an issue, along with the fact that their \"after 10\" policy seemed inconsistently enforced. Before tonight, I never hesitated to recommend Lolo's.

Just about nothing beats the juicy fried chicken breast smothered in gravy with a waffle on the side dripping in sweet syrup. Seriously, it's heaven for your mouth. \n\nHighlights: \nSweet tea - Sweet as in it tastes like there's 5,000 packs of sugar in there and will send you into a diabetic coma. Hell yeah!\n\nGreens- I love greens. These greens taste like they're made with bacon. Again, hell yeah! \n\nPotatoes and gravy- The gravy could be a little thicker but I still love it.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like too much was the mac and cheese. \n\nThe service was fantastic, everyone was kind, prompt, and attentive. You can be waiting quite a while for a table, especially on Sunday mornings when people are coming back from church. Get there right when they open and don't worry about suffering from heat stroke in the summer. Or just wait in your car with the AC blasting until your name gets called.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Lo-lo's is better by FAR.\n\nWhy? One word: gravy. \n\nThe chicken is tender, juicy, and fried to perfection here. Not overly greasy. The waffles? Just perfect waffles with lots of flavor. The grits? Buttery. The Eggs? Tastes like crack when its scrambled with onions. The drinks\/kool-aid? Ridiculous size. The gravy?\n\nRIDICULOUS. Getting the gravy on the side is the best decision you'll ever make. Unlike Roscoe's, which pairs regular brown gravy, Lo-lo's pairs some sort of spiced and onioned concoction that reminds me of the drippings gravy you make on Turkey Day. I literally dipped my entire meal (waffles, grits, eggs) in this gravy and still couldn't get enough.\n\nMy only grip is that the Lo-lo's in Scottsdale takes amex, but this one doesn't. =(.\n\nBut seriously, Lo-lo's....could eat it every day.

You know - he sits on the couch, slouched with his hand down the front of his pants to give more room to his gut.  That's me right now, only with WAY better hair.\nHad the #10.  Because I'm a 10, get it?  Two chicken legs with a waffle.  I went with Julia T., Jason W., Nathan S., Amanda B., and David SB tonight.  We all ordered different sides so we could share.  Our end of the table shared the collard greens , mac and cheese and candied sweet potatoes.\nThe platter of chicken and waffles arrived.  You should see the scoop of butter on the waffle!  A scoop!  Not a pat!  The chicken legs were perfectly done - moist, not greasy, with an awesome coating that wasn't too much.  The waffle was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I'm glad it came with syrup, not maple syrup.  I detest maple anything.  I lived in New England too long.\nNathan leaned over and suggested we pretend we were making an Ice Cube movie, Babershop-style, and pick an actor to play each of us.  I was Angela Bassett, of course.  \nCollard green were yummy!  Not over-cooked, with hunks of the stems thrown in.  The sweet potatoes were pretty sweet, but not overly so.  Mac and cheese?  Yes, please! (that rhymed!)  And the tea.  Ohhhhhh the tea.  I got the half and half sweet.  I figured there was enough sugar in my meal that I didn't want to bounce off the walls and crash like a 4-year old after Halloween.  I had two huge glasses - actually, jars.  It's served in Kerr canning jars.  The big ones.  It was so good (How good was it???) that as I got up from my corner seat and walked around to leave, I reached over to take one last huge swig.  \nI'm full.

This place serves all day breakfast and is open for 24 hours and is likely a good spot if you're for some decent food at a great price if you're craving in the middle of the night.\n\nThe service was very friendly and the place was fairly empty with a group or two coming in while we were there to sit down and eat. The menu contains kids meals, dinner (steak and pasta), sandwiches, and breakfast. Everything is quite cheap! Note that for breakfast after 5pm there is an extra dollar charge. \n\nWe ordered a steak and eggs breakfast and chocolate chip pancakes. The steak I asked to be cooked medium rare, but it is quite a thin steak and I found it hard to chew. The flavor was okay. No complaints for something that cost 8 dollars! The eggs were good and the potatoes were the best part if the meal. They were hot and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It also came with two slices of buttered toast. \n\nThe pancakes were super cheap for quite a large portion, but they were a little chewy. It might have been more fresh if we had eaten in the morning. They came out at room temperature and they weren't hot enough for the butter to melt.\n\nWe also decided to order some of their pulled pork poutine which I thought was okay. It was a little too salty but the flavor wasn't bad. The fries were a little starchy feeling and I felt like it was more cheese and pulled pork on top of fries rather than poutine. \n\nOverall a decent experience. Will we be back? Maybe.

That alone is already an incredibly attractive feature (cause who doesn't get the munchies at midnight?)\n\nUpon first glance, the outside was highy unattractive to say the least, but based on some reviews that recommended I ignore the exterior...I ignored it and was so glad I did.\n\nThe inside is a different world. Newly renovated, screens all around, comfy seating and a decent size sitting area. It was very shiny and clean, had nice tables and chairs etc. (Even the washrooms were clean!). An environment that seldom exists in a 24h joint thats for sure! +1 star\n\nThere were a few people ahead of us in line but we waited a total of less than 10 minutes before being seated...which for a sunday morning is unheard of! +1 star\n\nThe menu was comprehensive. ..easy to follow, not too crowded but not too limited either. The prices...wow! 2.99 eggs and toast, 5.99 breakfasts 6.99 bennies?! My expectations dropped a little due to the prices because I knew id be leaving with a bill lower than $15 bucks. (Infact, I paid $10!!!) +1 star\n\nI ordered the eggs bennie with a side of home fries (to replace the fruits) and 2 pancakes. They accomodated my substitutions happily and the service was VERY fast (we had our orders in 15 minutes) and the waiters were definitely friendly. +1 star\n\nThe only downfall is that the spinach on my bannies were a bit to salty, my eggs wernt runny like I like then and the pancakes were good but not the absolute best. Overall the food was very decent considering all the other perks this place has to offer. My food complaints take a back seat to the prices, portion sizes, service, hours of operation and cleanliness this place had to offer.

I've already tried Magic Noodle (which is definitely worth a try - take a peek at my review! [[shameless self-advertising]])\nBut I looked over the Yelp reviews of Honey B and decided to take a shot.\n\nThis restaurant is tucked behind a gas station, next to a bar, an Indian restaurant, and an adult video store.  After going over some oddly placed speed bumps I arrived at a very ordinary restaurant.\n\nInside is bright, it's clean, and it definitely smells like breakfast.\n\nThe server was polite and efficient - he seated us, got us our menus, and then took our orders on an iPad.  When he got me my take-out box he pulled the bag apart and placed it so it would be easier for me to fit the container into the bag.  \n\nI had the Working B Breakfast and I would've paid double the amount for what it costed me.  The pancakes are fluffy and happy (not like the soggy ones you get from 24 hour diners), the peameal, ham, and bacon were tasty and not too oil, the home fries (my boyfriend ate all of them), and the eggs were done perfectly for an over-easy.  The only thing that I was unsatisfactory was that they sprinkled a little powdered sugar onto my eggs from my pancakes and I was mad confused for a second or two.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs.  He destroyed everything on his plate and then helped me destroy the pull-pork poutine.\n\nI had to order thanks to the previous reviews and it was most definitely worth it.  The pulled-pork + fries + cheese combination was dynamite.  The fries were crisp, the gravy was 100% and everything mixed together is something I am re-ordering when I come back next time.\n\nThis meal costed me roughly $30.\n\nThis place was excellent from service, to decoration (read the chalkboard where the darts are haha), and to quality of food.  \n\nNever mind comparing it to other 24hour diners it is in the same league as higher end restaurants.  \n\nMy boyfriend has already issued his statement of returning here if he ever decides he needs late night drunk meals on the weekends.

The portions here are massive especially considering the price you pay, so we may have overdone it a bit by ordering four things for two people last night... blame me and my gluttony...\n\nAfter reading reviews, I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to try, and I did NOT hold back. I ordered the pulled pork poutine and mussels in white wine sauce to start, thinking they would both be fairly small appetizer portions, but no, they are like full plates. Followed that up with the squid ink spaghetti while my mom ordered the salmon linguine (they ran out of linguine so she substituted with spaghetti.) I also decided to add $4 to make my order a combo, with a soup and salad and dessert (creme brulee). For $3 you get a choice of soup OR salad and a dessert.\n\nI think my expectations were quite high, so the food didn't blow me away. The poutine ($4.99), which everyone raves about, was good and was my mom's favourite dish. I liked the barbeque sauce they used on the pork, which added a nice bit of sweetness to it. I think it could have used more cheese and could have been warmer. I would have liked to see those stringy bits of melted cheese, which were a rather lacking. 3.5\/5\n\nI liked the mussels in white wine sauce ($6.99) and was surprised that my mom didn't find it flavourful enough. But I thought the flavour was fine, the sauce was tasty, and the mussels were abundant. 4\/5\n\nThe salmon spaghetti ($13.99) was unfortunately a miss for both me and my mom. The sauce (was there even sauce?) was really really light, I think it might have been just olive oil based. As a result, the dish overall was a bit bland, and the noodles were a bit tough and dry. The salmon was okay. 2\/5\n\nLuckily for me, the squid ink spaghetti ($16.99) I ordered was a lot better. With all the squid ink sauce, it was definitely nice and moist, and also made my noodles softer. There was a decent amount of seafood in there - a couple of shrimp, small scallops, squid, etc. Flavouring was pretty light and let most of the natural seafood flavours shine through. I mostly just love the look of the pasta with all the noodles being all dark and black and ominous looking... mmm right up my alley. Be warned though, the ink will get all over your lips no matter how carefully you try to eat - I thought I looked pretty badass, mom thought it was hilarious. Probably best to avoid ordering this one on a first date... unless your date is into that goth look. 3.5\/5\n\nThe salad, soup and dessert that came with my meal were pretty standard. The soup (I think it was cream of cauliflower) was way too watery, not creamy enough at all, and a bit bland. The creme brulee was okay, although there were parts of the top that weren't hard enough so didn't crack when I tapped at them, they just kind of... sank into the custard. Tasted fine though.\n\nThere was only one waitress working, but also not a lot of other patrons. The waitress was sweet, and I thought made a good effort to provide good service. She brought us an extra spoon when I asked so we could share the soup, and also an extra bowl. She was also pretty attentive and brought our food out super quickly from the kitchen. \n\nI think this is a cute little diner to check out if you are in the area. The prices are reasonable, but not like dirt cheap or anything, especially for the pasta. The portions are, however, substantial for what you are paying - we only finished the mussels and most of the poutine and maybe half of each our pasta dishes. In total our bill for the night came out to about $53. Some of their other items however are a steal e.g. steak for $10, so may come back for a second try. In general I didn't have any problems with this place, I think it's pretty decent, but just didn't find it to be as amazing as other reviewers did.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

This place is interesting coz they got almost everything I want from all-day breakfast to steaks and pastas. They even have sandwiches and value meals in the daytime. So we went for dinner and ordered mussels with white wine for appetizer, 8oz. striploin, ribeye steak, full-rack bbq ribs, and spaghetti with meatballs. All of them were delicious and better than what i expected. The price was very good, the food quality was great and the portions were huge especially the pasta. Even the appetizers and +$4 combo (soup, salad, and dessert) were big that we almost got full before the main course was served. The dessert had options of either crème brûlée or fruit cup. I wish they would serve refillable iced tea though and some cocktail drinks like margarita. The ambience was nice. The flat screen TV's were a plus. You can't really complain considering the price of the food and the server was very nice. The only thing that's strange was the location especially at night. It was quiet but it was kinda odd that it's beside a gas station and an empty space.

What can I say, the place is really good, nothing bad to say at all. The food is fantastic and the service was excellent.  The place is nicely decorated and cosy. They have tv's around the walls with different channels on, it was the sports channels and CP24. \nMy kids ordered a kids burger with fries, chicken fingers and fries and my eldest ordered a oatmeal and fruit breakfast combo with an extra side of bacon. I got the striploin steak and it came with mashed potatoes. My friend got the regular burger and we ordered a side of chicken wings too. All the food was delicious. Most outstanding were the burgers. The kids burger was huge, the regular burger is half pound of pattie. The patties were juicy, flavourful, good texture and cooked to perfection. No black charred bits!  My daughter's breakfast was oatmeal and fruit. It came with milk and brown sugar on the side and the fruit cup was really fresh chopped fruit, much better than Coras. Steak was lovely, for a few extra dollars you can add soup, salad and dessert to dinner entrees to create a full 4 course dinner. Only thing I would criticize is the wings. I personally like breaded wings, the wings here are huge but not breaded. If you like unbreaded wings, these are for you. \nAbsolutely great place to grab a casual bite to eat. I'm definitely coming back for breakfast next. Prices are fantastic too, cost was just over $60 inc tax. (2 adults, 3 kids plus 4 pops) It cost me $55 at Montanas for lunch today, and we were 1 person down.  \nFantastic food and really affordable prices.

I'm not a fan of buying pancakes from restaurants, because it's never as fluffy as I want it. But this hits the spot.

Had to check it out for myself\n\nPros:\nSuper good value\n\nCons:\nNot enough servers\n\nIt's hard to believe you can get a steak dinner for $10 these days but Honey B Hives has one and it's pretty decent for what you're paying.  On top of that, the rib steak dinner is only $17 which is pretty crazy too.\n\nWe ordered both steak dinners and a create your own pasta for our little one.  I added a soup and dessert to my meal for $3.  The soup that comes with your meal is a pretty big bowl.  It's much bigger than the bowls used elsewhere for soup. The steak dinners come with a potatoes and veggies.  The potatoes were a mix between scalloped and mashed but they were pretty good, very buttery!!\n\nSo let's be honest with the steak.  It won't be the best of the juiciest steaks you've ever had.  But for the price, they are very good steaks.  It was a very satisfying meal to say the least,  If you want a steak and don't want to break the bank, this place is a good option for you,\n\nMy little one's pasta was crazy big for the $7 price.  The table beside us got the poutine and it was huge for what you're paying as well.  It's basically the whole theme to this place if you ask me.\n\nThe only thing gripe-able about this place is the amount of servers they have.  They had exactly 1 server for a place that can serve about 30 people.  I don't know if this was a one time thing or not.  The server herself was excellent but once a party of about 12 people came, obviously she couldn't keep up to well. We came in before the group but you knew the two tables that came after would be waiting a bit longer than usual.\n\nAll in all, this is a great little place to go to get the most out of your buck.  It won't be anywhere near the best steak you've had, but for what you're paying, it's a decent trade off.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Service was great.\n\nAfter my second visit I've been visiting this place about once or twice a month. I feel their food is good for the most part except the breakfast. Their food is a 3 star rating but the cheap prices and good services gains an extra star.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I was genuinely surprised by what they served and how much each dish cost. I decided to try this place once and for all after all the talking and stalling. Came with my cousin tonight and both of us said we will be back soon. First of all, this place is twenty-f'en-four hours, seven-f'en-days a week.. Who the hell beats that? This place got all day breakferst and pasta. This place serves booze. This place does motha f'en take out.. And had a dart room away from the dining floor. Too awesome..\n\nWhen we entered, we were greeted by a young asian female. She was soft spoken and had the biggest and most genuine smile as she welcomed us. She made my day.. My cousin and I both ordered the AAA steak and eggs ($8.99). I was planning on ordering the Worker B breakfast but couldn't because I had too much kit kat from Japan that my cousin bought me. I can tell you right off the bat that the steak was only decent. It was cooked thoroughly, which I do not approve and way too thin. I was expecting the thin part, not the well-done cook job. The meat was fresh, just over cooked. It didn't look like it was seared.. That's what happens to steak in a Chinese kitchen lol jk. The home fries were fantastic and the eggs were regular to large size, in total egg heaven. We also ordered the pulled pork Poutine for $4.99 - the cheapest and decent tasting Poutine around the area. Fries were fresh and the pork had bbq sauce lavished all over with a hint of tangy-ness to it - gave the poutine a slight kick. I totally approve and recommend this place to all my fellow breakferst lovers! I suggest the worker b breakfast because it's $9.99 for 3 eggs, 3 choice of meat, home fries, toast AND pancake. You won't have to pay extra for pancakes like you do at Eggsmart or Cora's. Took off a star because this place was so hidden + the \"open\" sign was not on; thought the place was closed when I got there.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I usually get the breakfast deal for 1.99 and it fills me up just enough to leave me satisfied. I've also tried the fish and chips and that was pretty bomb. The fish was soft and tender and not dried out like most places I've been to. The steak on the other hand isn't what most would picture. It's a pretty thin piece of meat that spans the length of your hand so I wouldn't recommend ordering that. Overall, service is great and friendly and it's a convenient place to grab cheap food at all hours of the day.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Based on the reviews, I was not surprised. As I was waiting, a woman walked in and sat down at a table that hadn't been cleaned off yet. I was waiting about fifteen minutes at this point. The staff did not acknowledge her. She hissed at them and they brought her a menu and she placed her order and had been eating it by the time I got a table.\n\nOnce I sat down, I waited about ten minutes or longer for someone to take my drink order. When I finally got the attention of someone, she told me that the other waitress was taking orders and took our menus. Now I had to get the attention of the other waitress. When I finally hailed her, I ordered my food. My boyfriend and I ordered the same thing. We got our coffee which was terrible. It was very burned. I love coffee so much and I have never tasted it this bad. When we got our food, which was steak and eggs, it wasnt fantastic. The steak was thin and salty, and it was cooked to medium, not to rare as I had requested. When the food was initially brought to us, I got mine first, then about halfway through my meal, my boyfriend got his. I never finished my coffee. I asked for the bill, requested debit, and I waited another ten minutes for the machine. If I was a dishonest person, I probably could have gotten away with walking out without paying. We stayed and paid but it was a long wait. The whole experience was probably like an hour and fourty-five minutes long. \n\nWe decided to give them another shot. We came here today. I was holding off this review until I could give them another chance. We walked in and we got a seat right away. Hurray! Things were looking up. We waited fifteen minutes before someone came to us for our drink orders, and I had to hail her down myself. My boyfriend ordered pancakes. I ordered eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. The coffee came and it was horrible again. Tasted burned. We waited again for the food, and when it as brought over, I was terribly disappointed. The plate was practically empty and I had ordered the second most expensive breakfast on the menu. The English muffin wasn't toasted. It was still cold. The smoked salmon was hardly there. The eggs were tiny, although cooked just the way I asked. And that all would be fine if it wasn't for the hollaindaie sauce. Oh my god, it was the worst thing I've ever tasted in my life. It reminded me of spoiled milk. Honestly it was like someone tried to make fondue with spoiled milk and spoiled cheese, except they put too much milk and now its a sauce. I hailed the waitress over, and I told her point blank that the food tasted like shit and feet. She took it away, told me she would talk to the kitchen, and never came back. My boyfriend finished his food. I had to hail her again to inquire as to what was happening. She came over and asked me what I would like to replace the food I ordered with, but my boyfriend had already finished eating. I knew it would be a while before I even got my food, and I felt like it would be so rude to make him wait, so I asked for the bill and we left. I spent an hour there and had a taste of horrible food that made me feel sick after.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I was a bit hesitant at first, since there were no other customers there when we got there. A few more customers showed up after 9pm, while we were eating. The waitress greeted us right away and sat us down in a prime location facing 4 TVs (1 playing CP24 and 3 playing the Jay's game). Then she brought out waters and the menu. The prices on the menu were quite reasonable which got our attention. We decided to share 3 items.\n\nMussels with White Wine Sauce ($6.99), Carbonara Fettuccine ($8.99), and a Philly Cheese Steak ($5.99). Our Mussels showed up in under 10mins. When the waitress brought out our Mussels, she asked if we would like the rest of our food to come out now, or wait till we were done the Mussels. Since we were sharing, we told her to bring them out all at once. 3mins later, she brought out the rest of our food. Talk about fast, of course it helps that we were the only ones there.\n\nThe Mussels were a really good portion size for only $6.99. Mussels were not super fresh, probably the frozen kind, but they were still good. The white wine sauce it was in was so good, me and sis gobbled it all down, completely ignoring the other food. I would order it again, and next time I'll get some fries as well to sop up the sauce with. Yum. The carbonara was ok, slightly different from what I was expecting. The potion size was good. It had scrambled eggs in it though, which means it wasn't made well. Taste was ok though if I didn't think of it as a carbonara. Just a tad blander than I would like. The Philly tasted ok, but I would have liked a bit more filling. The bun wasn't toasted for very long, so the bottom bread got slightly soggy while it sat there waiting for us to finish with the mussels. \n\nService was good and fast. Our waitress remembered to check on us regularly, and removed our empty plates and refilled our water without needing to be asked. The place was pretty clean for a 24hr place. Overall, the food was probably a 3 star, but the attentive service, good portions, and reasonable prices makes it a 4 star. It helps that its very close to where I live, so I'll probably be back whenever I don't feel like cooking to try more items. The BF has already requested that I bring him here after seeing pics I took of the food and menu.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I gave it another shot, this time with peameal. It was disgusting. The English muffin was not toasted enough and became soggy. The hollandaise was less edible than the last time I came here. If you do come here stick to bacon sausages and eggs and stay far away from the eggs Benedict. There was no finesse in this dish. I couldn't finish.
